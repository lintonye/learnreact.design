   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Should designers code? This is an eternal question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe designers and developers should both learn a bit about the profession of the other side. Armed with a holistic understanding of how design and engineering fit together to create great products, we will become better designers and better developers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a developer who’s benefited from learning design, I’m convinced that designers want to learn some coding as well. That is why I got so excited about creating a React course tailored for designers (excited about the course too? Sign up &lt;a href=&quot;http://learnreact.design&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and I’ll keep you in the loop).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait a second. Am I just thinking in the vacuum though? I decided to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.designernews.co/stories/82837-react-native-course-for-designers-anyone&quot;&gt;ask Designer News&lt;/a&gt;. The result? I was totally blown away! The post has been the top story for more than a day and stayed on the front page for more than a week. Shortly after the post, 13 designers booked a call with me and wished to offer help. Wow! 13 real people were willing to spare 30 minutes out of their busy schedules to talk to a complete stranger – me. There must be something that resonates with them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/designer-interviews/interview-calendar.png&quot; alt=&quot;My Interview Calendar&quot; /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;[ My calendar got quickly filled up by meeting requests ]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is a report of the interviews that I’ve done so far. Hopefully you will be inspired to learn some React as well after reading about your peers’ opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you feel generous to help me shape the course too, I’m really excited to talk to you! Please schedule a call with me &lt;a href=&quot;https://calendly.com/lintonye&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;! I will keep this post updated with your new thoughts and opinions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve asked quite a few questions and got great responses. They fall in the following 5 categories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Interviewee background&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should designers code?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Why do you want to learn React?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What do you want to learn about React?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How do you learn coding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main body of this post consists of quotes that I found interesting and my comments. Let’s now dive in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;interviewee-background&quot;&gt;Interviewee background&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most interviewees are UX/UI designers working on mobile or web projects. A few of them said they have an engineering background but decided to pursue design as a career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly everyone I talked to uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sketchapp.com/&quot;&gt;Sketch&lt;/a&gt; for prototyping. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html&quot;&gt;After Effects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.invisionapp.com/&quot;&gt;InVision&lt;/a&gt; are also frequently mentioned. To my surprise, nearly half of the interviewees use &lt;a href=&quot;https://framer.com/&quot;&gt;Framer&lt;/a&gt; which requires coding to take advantage of its full capability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also learned about a couple of tools that are popular but I’ve never heard of. They are &lt;a href=&quot;http://principleformac.com/&quot;&gt;Principle&lt;/a&gt; for prototyping and &lt;a href=&quot;https://zeplin.io/&quot;&gt;Zeplin&lt;/a&gt; for design hand-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;programming-experience&quot;&gt;Programming experience&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two interviewees have experience in full-stack development alongside design. But the majority of people I’ve talked to don’t have much coding experience. They have various experience in HTML and CSS, and are somewhat familiar with JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encouragingly, quite a few of them have tried some coding bootcamps or online tutorials to try to learn Swift, React etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;should-designers-code&quot;&gt;Should designers code?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found is that designers, at least those who I’ve talked to, are actually quite motivated to code. This doesn’t mean that they want to build everything on their own. But they are well aware of the benefits of involving coding into their workflow and want to learn more about technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are discussions that touch down the core problem of designer-developer collaboration, the benefits for a designers to understand technology and its implication on creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More interestingly, some designers use coding, notably Framer, to do design itself. I believe this trend will have a profound impact on how UI design is done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;designer-developer-collaboration&quot;&gt;Designer-developer collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the interviews, I have an assumption that there is a communication gap between designers and developers. I’m trying to bridge this gap by helping designers understand a bit more about how a developer’s job is like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s interesting to hear designers talking about their own pain points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Designers and developers speak different languages, the jargons are different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Design and engineering uses different part of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Designers are very aware that working with engineers is super important and there is a lot of motivation on the designer’s side to make that relationship (with developers) as good as possible. But motivation isn’t always enough if you don’t understand anything about the coding side. It’s very easy, especially as a junior designer, to propose things that are annoyingly completely out of scope, ridiculous and have no bearing on reality. Even if you are very motivated to work as well as possible with engineers, that can be frustrating because there’s so much that you don’t understand about what their job is like. So I think it is a problem and there’s a lot of energy behind solving it right now, which is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As a designer, when you create an animation, you’ll have to pass it over to a developer to implement it. But the developer might be busy with other things and probably don’t have a chance to implement it for a couple of months. The animation will just sit there. It may be pretty but until it is implemented in the app and distributed to people, your value isn’t quite there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Designers for the most part have no understanding of code but are interested in contributing their designs into the apps they’re working on though limited by the the dev resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The communication problem (between designers and developers) is often caused by the lack of empathy for the other person, a developer would think that the designer is just doing the modification of the UI, a designer would think the developer is just writing code and not thinking about the vision and UX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-a-designer-understands-technology&quot;&gt;When a designer understands technology…&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benefits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once you have an holistic view of how design and engineering interacts, there is no doubt about how it will help the team to reach better / more efficient way to achieve the goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I don’t write code, but I can understand the developer saying we are using HTML5 and CSS3. I know certain attributes that the language has, for example, transparency and gradient. I know that I don’t have to give assets for all these things that can be directly implemented in the code. If you are aware of certain capability of the technology, the communication becomes easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If your designer have the technology background, you can create mockups that are based on reality, not something that’s functionally wrong or broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;…the time you spend on learning a new thing, versus the time you’ll save in the future by using the new knowledge. In the short term, it makes sense to stick on what you are really good at. But skills that you are already good at are hard to make better. If you start something new, it won’t take as much time to grow it to a useful level. At the end you’ll have this amount of Sketch skill and this amount of coding skill. This is a lot more powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implications:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When you are bound by a tool (coding), it hampers your creativity, because you start thinking in terms of the capability of the tool. For me, my favorite starting point is still pen and paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-coding-to-design&quot;&gt;Using coding to design&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve been using coding to do most of my design. Because once you’ve done design in code, I just realized it’s really easy to change and swap the order, randomize photos inside a layout. Even though it has some learning curve, but once you start making some concepts, suddenly it starts saving a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Direct benefit is copy and paste. When you start a new project, it often has some similarity to what you’ve worked on previously. If you use code, you can copy and paste, you can change the variables so everything is changed all at once. You can change a value globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I use Framer which uses CoffeeScript. Technically it’s not the code that a developer can copy and paste, but still it’s really easier for them to read, compared to just looking at a video and guess what needs to be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;No matter they like it or not, designers are now aware that coding is one of the options for design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-do-you-want-to-learn-react&quot;&gt;Why do you want to learn React?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular motivation is that they are working on a project that uses React (either ReactJS&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; or React Native). They want to know how to work with developers better, and they want to have more direct influence on the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, many people are not really aware of (or care about) the difference between React Native and ReactJS. I told them that the good news is React as a concept is the same. Once you learn one of the two, it’s straightforward to pick up the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We just hired a React Native developer. I’m interested in learning how to work with React Native developers because I haven’t done so before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;(My company uses React) I feel helpless a lot when I want to make changes. All our engineers are in India and Russia. (the designer is in the US) A lot of times there are small style changes. I would love to be able to go and just make it myself. I can’t at the moment. Sometimes I have ideas that I’d like to build on my own, my portfolio included, but I just don’t have the skill set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to take time to learn a new skill because It will further my career. It’d be great if I’m able to call my project manager or engineer about something that’s said to be impossible in React Native, and I can say, well, actually it is possible. It kinda helps. You can have a really interesting conversation if you know something about the technology. For example, I’d want to use shadows blurred in my design. (But the developer told me) that’s not possible because we are using this library in React Native, and we’d have to update the library and have to this and that. I was like, well, Is it really the truth? I’ve seen apps that have blurred shadows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It seems more and more people are using ReactJS. What I’m looking is to understand a bit more how it works, what options are, what it can or cannot do. Not necessarily building a complete app on my own. But when you are working with a client, it’d be good to know the language a bit better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also some really interesting discussions about including React into their design workflow:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We have Sketch style guides that we keep in sync with our designers. The engineers have style guides in React Storybook. But Ideally we should only have a single source of truth we can all just draw from. For me, I’d like to learn enough about React that I can make small changes to the React Storybook and then push out to the rest of designers in Sketch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I heard the React Sketch app from Airbnb. That’s something that actually motivated me to start thinking, maybe I should learn some React. With Framer, the only way to save a picture is to take a screenshot. If the developer wants something I draw with code, I have to trace back to Sketch or PhotoShop, which is annoying. But if there is an option to convert code into images (in Sketch), I have options. I can export it PNG, JPG, SVG. I think that’s really cool for most designers. It’s good for documentation as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-do-you-want-to-learn-about-react&quot;&gt;What do you want to learn about React?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems a consensus that designers want to learn about React in terms of what it can and cannot do at a high level. Meanwhile, a few interviewees have expressed the interest to learn how to build a full app since they want to build their own ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Would like to know about the technology in terms of capability and technical boundary, but not specifically deep dive into code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;What I want to learn is not necessarily how to write apps myself, but be able to collaborate with the developer on a higher level, say, to know what his constraints are, what he can do, so I can provide him with documents and files that are easier for him to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s important for designers to know what constraints are, what can’t be done in React Native, but can in Swift or Objective-C. .. Not necessarily how the thing is made, but what can be made. What are the differences between platforms. For the designers, the things that they need to perform their jobs the best they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I just figured that the deliverables (required by RN) are different from what I’m used to. I would have issues with SVG because React Native doesn’t like SVG files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to be able to edit it (the code), but not necessarily interested in coding the whole thing by myself. There’s somebody whose job is to do that…. In web development, I can always go into the file and find what’s not working the way I wanted, and change it. It’s helpful to send him (the developer) a code snippet for the drop shadow, or hex code, so he doesn’t have to tweak the thing himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I want to learn to build a full app, just to get my hands dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In my case, I’m interested in learning how to structure my code, and things like Redux and Mobx.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-do-you-learn-coding&quot;&gt;How do you learn coding?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designers are really motivated in learning coding as self-improvement. They’ve taken online courses on sites such as Code School, CodeAcademy, Lynda, went to workshops, attended webinars etc.  I’m proud of you, my friends!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are just a couple of examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’ve gone through all Apple’s Swift classes, SkillShare classes and learn with a full-stack developer friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;After learning Framer, I tried some other languages. I’m learning Swift these days. One thing I realized was that compared to prototyping, the actual programming languages, such as Swift and Java, are more strict about how you write code. I found that’s too much for what I want. I just want to use code to configure the design without doing too much labor intensive work that I used to do with Sketch or PhotoShop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am thrilled! I think many designers are motivated to learn coding. React is one of their favorite topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you inspired to pick up some React as well? Sign up &lt;a href=&quot;http://learnreact.design&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ll send you an email when something is ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;acknowledgements&quot;&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d like to thank everyone who spent your precious time to chat with me, made a comment or upvoted my post. Your insights will really have a huge influence on the course. Together, let’s create something truly useful for designers!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>React Navigation: Shared element transition 3/3 (the animation)</title>

   <published>2017-04-22T00:00:00-07:00</published>
   <updated>2017-04-22</updated>
   <id>http://learnreact.design/2017/04/22/react-navigation-shared-element-transition-3</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a series of posts about how to create custom transition “views” using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactnavigation.org/&quot;&gt;React Navigation&lt;/a&gt; (based on “NavigationExperiemental”):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shared element transition 3/3: the animation (this post)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time flies! I really appreciate your patience for this piece. In fact, I’ve been busy with something fairly relevant:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/pull/941&quot;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt; for shared element transition in React Navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/issues/175&quot;&gt;proposal and initial implementation&lt;/a&gt; of custom transitions in React Navigation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A couple of courses about React Native (more on that in future posts).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alright, enough excuses. :) Let’s continue our adventure about shared element transition. In the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/25/react-navigation-shared-element-transition-2&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve discussed the core challenges in implementing shared element transition. Once we get the bounding boxes of the shared elements on both from and to scenes, we’ll be ready to animate them. Let’s finally look at that in this post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the full source code in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lintonye/react-native-diary/tree/master/transitions&quot;&gt;this repo&lt;/a&gt;. However, I’ve generalized the core ideas and implemented a generic way to create custom transitions in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/pull/941&quot;&gt;this pull request&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to compare the two and you’ll find the connection. Of course the latter should be considered more mature, and it’s still evolving as you can tell from the comments on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-more-preparation&quot;&gt;Some more preparation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before actually animating the shared elements, let’s do some prep work: we’ll study closely how to create an overlay, how to clone items onto it, a handy notion that makes things easier (“from” and “to” items), and whether to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; to create the animations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overlay&quot;&gt;Overlay&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recall that most of the magic happens on an overlay? We want an overlay that covers the entire screen and is visible only during transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from making it absolutely positioned, we need to set a high enough elevation value on Android to make sure the overlay covers everything, for example toolbars that usually have higher elevation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;StyleSheet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;overlay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;absolute&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;bottom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;elevation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// make sure it&#39;s on the top on Android.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To show and hide the overlay, we can just animate its opacity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;animatedContainerStyle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;transitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.0001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.9999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, to prevent the overlay from eating up all touch events, we’ll set its &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pointerEvents&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;overlay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;animatedContainerStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;pointerEvents=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;none&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;clones&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cloning-shared-elements-and-hiding-the-originals&quot;&gt;Cloning shared elements and hiding the originals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have an overlay, we can clone the shared elements using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;React.cloneElement()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cloneElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reactElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reactElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;clonedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;animatedStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`clone-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the code above, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;item.reactElement&lt;/code&gt; is a React element (the result of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt;) saved when the shared element registers itself (this is covered in detail in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/25/react-navigation-shared-element-transition-2&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;animatedStyle&lt;/code&gt; is the style that we are going to create soon to actually animate the cloned views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the transition more realistic, we also want to hide the original views during the transition. This is fairly similar to how we show/hide the overlay:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;originalViewStyle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;transitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.9999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;items-on-from-and-to-routes&quot;&gt;Items on “from” and “to” routes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to animate a shared item, we need to measure its original bounding box before the transition starts, and its final bounding box when the transition completes. But how do we know which item is the origin and which is the destination? We can use a handy notion of “from” and “to” routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown below, we can get the “from” and “to” routes whenever the component receives a new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/code&gt; prop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;componentWillReceiveProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getRoute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;routes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_fromRoute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_toRoute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we can deduct which items are on “from” and “to” routes, respectively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isOnRoute&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;item&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;routeName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;routeName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fromItems&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;allItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isOnRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_fromRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toItems&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;allItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isOnRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_toRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;position-or-progress&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you recall, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;transitionProps&lt;/code&gt; includes two animated values: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt;. When creating the style for the overlay above, I used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; just for convenience. Its &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/code&gt; is very simple to set up since the value of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; always changes from 0 to 1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this simplicity of inputRange is also its disadvantage. Since it always goes from 0 to 1, we cannot use it to distinguish the direction of a transition, i.e. whether we’re opening a new screen, or moving back to an existing screen. We are confined to create the same animation in either direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see this issue in action by doing the edge swipe gesture on iOS which navigates back to an existing screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;282&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/cCKeLtPDQ1c?controls=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As shown above, the shared element on the overlay is never visible while the edge swipe is happening. This is because &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; stays &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; which makes the opacity of the overlay always &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; is here to the rescue. It represents the index of the current screen in the stack. When opening a new screen, its value increases, e.g. from 0 to 1. On the other direction, its value decreases, e.g from 4 to 3. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; is updated continuously both during the transition and when the user is performing an edge swipe gesture. We can now create different animations for different transition directions based on this value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course it’s trickier to set up the inputRange in the interpolation since the value range isn’t fixed. To handle that, we compute the maximum and minimum indices of “from” and “to” routes, and use them as input range values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;max&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_fromRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_toRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;minIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_fromRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_toRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;animatedContainerStyle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;transitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;minIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;minIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.0001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxIndex&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.0001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;maxIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the result after we use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; to interpolate every animated style:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;282&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/ntTj0Y_oWKs?controls=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;animating-shared-elements&quot;&gt;Animating shared elements&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s now time to animate the shared elements! Even with all the preparation that we’ve done, it’s still trickier than I originally expected (that’s why it took me so much time!). We need to choose which style props to animate based on the type of the view. Please read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;animating-scale&quot;&gt;Animating scale&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first approach I thought of was to animate the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scaleX&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scaleY&lt;/code&gt; according to the sizes of the shared elements on the from and to scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scaleX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Note: this assumes fromIndex &amp;lt; toIndex. If fromIndex &amp;gt; toIndex,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// we need to reverse both inputRange and outputRange.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fromIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fromItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scaleX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scaleY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are actually more steps to get the animation exactly right, but let’s skip them since this approach has a problem: if the aspect ratio of the shared item changes when moving to the next scene, the animation will look a little strange:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;282&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/Nk2PG7OZ_mA?controls=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This led me to explore other approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;animating-widthheight&quot;&gt;Animating width/height&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact if the shared item is an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/code&gt;, we can just animate its width and height! (how come didn’t I think of this in the first place…) If the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;resizeMode&lt;/code&gt; of the shared item remain the same on the from and to scenes, the animation looks pretty good even if the aspect ratio changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;282&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/LJl0hNzoWmg?controls=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s fairly straightforward to create the animations as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Note: this assumes fromIndex &amp;lt; toIndex. If fromIndex &amp;gt; toIndex, we need to reverse both inputRange and outputRange.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fromIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toIndex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fromItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;  
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;animating-fontsize&quot;&gt;Animating fontSize&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know how to animate images, what about Text? Simply animating width or height or the scale won’t work well. We want to animate its fontSize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is how we could get the font sizes of the “from” and “to” items. We know that font size is defined in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; prop of a Text. Is it as simple as just extracting it from the style?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fontSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reactElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fontSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really. We indeed need to work with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; prop, but it takes a couple of extra steps to actually get the fontSize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we print out the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; prop of a react element, we’ll see something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are all styles reduced to just a number? It turns out that the styles are cached in a central registry where we can look up by an index (e.g. the number &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;20&lt;/code&gt; above) and get the actual style object:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ReactNativePropRegistry&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;ReactNativePropRegistry&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;styleObj&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ReactNativePropRegistry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getByID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fontSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;styleObj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, React Native allows us to assign an array to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; prop where a style appears at the rear overrides those at the front:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Text&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;commonText&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;fontSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This needs some special treatment. We need to recursively walk through the embedded arrays to find the last fontSize and extract its value, either from the registry or directly if it’s a style object.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put things together, we can get the font size of a React element like so:&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fontSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;findLastFontSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isNumber&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fontSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fontSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fontSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getFontSize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;findLastFontSize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we know the font size of both “from” and “to” items, it is a cakewalk to animate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;revisiting-goals&quot;&gt;Revisiting goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK Great! By far we’ve covered all aspects of creating a shared element transition. At the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/23/react-navigation-shared-element-transition-1&quot;&gt;beginning&lt;/a&gt;, we set three goals for this experiment. Let’s revisit them to see how well we are doing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-pure-javascript&quot;&gt;1. Pure JavaScript&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one is apparent, I’ve never written a line of Java or Objective-C or Swift in the posts, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-minimal-api&quot;&gt;2. Minimal API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/25/react-navigation-shared-element-transition-2&quot;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt;, I presented an API like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// on photo grid screen&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SharedView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;photo1&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;containerRouteName=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;PhotoGrid&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;source=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is reasonable, but you’ll actually notice an even simpler API in the shared element transition &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/pull/941&quot;&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Transition&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SharedElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;photo1&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two improvements involved here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instead of using a wrapper &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SharedView&lt;/code&gt; which can bloat up the jsx fairly quickly, you can use a HOC (higher order component) in the same fashion as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/code&gt; components.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The prop &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;containerRouteName&lt;/code&gt; is removed since the same information can be passed via context.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m confident that this API is fairly easy to use now. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-reasonably-smooth-on-older-devices&quot;&gt;3. Reasonably smooth on older devices&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set a performance goal of 40 FPS on an old Nexus 5, roughly the same as the frame rate of the default CardStack animation. So far the best I can achieve is 20-30 FPS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see what caused the dropped frames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;usenativedriver--false&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;useNativeDriver = false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Animated library has a hidden configuration property &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;useNativeDriver&lt;/code&gt;. If set to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, native code will be used to drive the animation. Otherwise, JavaScript will be the driver which is understandably much slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the default CardStack transition where &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;useNativeDriver&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, unfortunately we have to set it to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; for shared element transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Remember we animated &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;height&lt;/code&gt; of images to achieve the best result? Sadly, the Animated native driver does not yet support these properties. In fact all properties that affect the layout are not supported yet, such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if we instead animate the scale properties (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scaleX&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scaleY&lt;/code&gt;) of shared elements, and use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;translateX&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;translateY&lt;/code&gt; to update their locations, we can use the native driver. The frame rate will be better, but images will be skewed if their aspect ratio changes during the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;extra-updates&quot;&gt;Extra updates&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second reason for the dropped frames is the extra work required to implement the shared element transition. This includes the measuring of the bounding boxes, and the registration of new shared elements when the component is mounted. The best we can do is to minimize the number of times they are executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bounding box measuring is particularly expensive (in the order of tens of milliseconds per element) because it involves calling into the native code and carrying the data back to JS. Therefore, we need to minimize the number of views that are measured during the transition. That’s why I added a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lintonye/react-navigation/blob/shared-element/src/views/Transition/Transitions/SharedElement.js#L89&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getItemsToMeasure&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/a&gt; in the PR which only returns the matching items on the “from” and “to” routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that I have spent quite a bit of time making sure the component updates only when necessary. I added a logging statement in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/code&gt; that prints the number of updates so far and then worked to reduce that number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;componentDidUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prevProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prevState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;updateCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;updateCount&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;updateCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`======&amp;gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;updateCount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt; cardStack updated`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique may be useful for you too to optimize the performance of your components. If you know better ways, let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, this is the final post about shared element transition. You can check out the code in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/react-community/react-navigation/pull/941&quot;&gt;this PR&lt;/a&gt; which also includes an implementation of custom transitions. In the mean time, the code in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lintonye/react-native-diary/tree/master/transitions&quot;&gt;this repo&lt;/a&gt; might be easier to understand since it’s only about shared element transition. However, it does not include some optimizations I’ve done in the aforementioned PR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what we’ve covered in this post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to create, show and hide the overlay&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to clone the shared elements and hide the original ones&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A handy notion that helps us determine which item is the origin and which item is the destination during the transition: “from” and “to” routes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A comparison of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; and why &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; is better&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Various ways to animate the shared elements, and why we don’t want to always animate the scale&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A discussion about the goals we set at the beginning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This journey turned out to be much longer (and rewarding) than I expected. I hope you have learned one thing or two by reading my struggles and be able to apply them in your own projects. In the meantime, I’m working with the rest of React Navigation team to make custom transitions as easy as possible, so that you don’t have to repeat what I’m doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think in the comments! Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a series of posts about how to create custom transition “views” using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactnavigation.org/&quot;&gt;React Navigation&lt;/a&gt; (based on “NavigationExperiemental”):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/23/react-navigation-shared-element-transition-1&quot;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve discussed some general ideas about how to create custom transitions like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/images/navigation-custom-transition/shared-elements-trimmed-480p.mov&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;source src=&quot;movie.ogg&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg&quot;&gt; --&gt;
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, let’s start tackling the core problem: how to animate the shared views. Sections below discuss the key challenges I’ve encountered and &lt;a href=&quot;#solution&quot;&gt;my solution&lt;/a&gt; to them. While they arose when making a specific transition, I believe they’ll be useful in many other things because we needed to dive deeper into how React works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;key-challenges&quot;&gt;Key challenges&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the magic happens on the overlay, and our overlay is rendered like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// class SharedElementsTransitioner&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_renderOverlay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(....)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sharedViews&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cloneAndAnimateSharedViews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(....);&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;overlayStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sharedViews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;     
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now here comes the question: What is this &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cloneAndAnimateSharedViews&lt;/code&gt; function supposed to look like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, we can just find all the shared views in the current and upcoming scenes, pair them up, retrieve their bounding boxes, clone them and create animated styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s give it a try:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// class SharedElementsTransitioner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cloneAndAnimateSharedViews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;transitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prevTransitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;shareViewPairs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;collectActiveSharedViewPairs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;transitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prevTransitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sharedViewPairs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pair&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Does this getBoundingBox() really work?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bboxFrom&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getBoundingBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fromItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bboxTo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getBoundingBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;animatedStyle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;createAnimatedStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bboxFrom&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bboxTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cloned&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cloneElement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pair&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fromItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;animatedStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cloned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;collectActiveSharedViewPairs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;transitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prevTransitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//TODO&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getBoundingBox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;//TODO&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now how do we implement the missing methods?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;collectActiveSharedViewPairs()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Shared views are scattered all over the place - they are defined in their corresponding scene components which are rendered as children of our transitioner. How do we visit these views? Is it easy to traverse the tree?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getBoundingBox()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Even if we can collect all the shared views, how do we get their bounding boxes? Is it as straightforward as in other UI frameworks, such as native Android?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To answer these questions, let’s go a bit deeper on how React works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;react-rendering-process&quot;&gt;React rendering process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s useful to view what’s happening in React as a two-step process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, React creates a “virtual tree” that represents the native view hierarchy (which is more famously known as “virtual DOM” in ReactJS). The nodes on this tree, called React elements, are just descriptors – they are plain objects with no references to the native widgets whatsoever. This step is where we, as React developers, can construct and update the user interface: we create React elements to describe what we want, typically in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; methods of components.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then, React feeds these descriptors into a “reconciliation” step when the native widgets are actually created and/or updated. React handles this process internally and transparently. We have no direct access of this process (and this is where React shines as it hides the complexities of the target UI platform).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;collectAndAnimateSharedViews&lt;/code&gt; is called, we are at the first step above. So what we can visit is a tree of React elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unique process creates some challenges when implementing the two aforementioned methods:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;collectActiveSharedViewPairs()&lt;/code&gt;:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Challenge 1: React element trees are shallow.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getBoundingBox()&lt;/code&gt;:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Challenge 2: No direct access to native widgets.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Challenge 3: Layout information only comes AFTER the virtual tree creation step.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me expand on them next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenge-1-react-element-trees-are-shallow&quot;&gt;Challenge 1: React element trees are shallow.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one hit me when I attempted to traverse the React element tree the same way as in other UI frameworks. I had the (wrong) intuition that the React element tree must have all nodes fully expanded and ready to be visited, something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;- View
  - Transitioner
    - PhotoGrid
      - ListView
        - SharedView
          - Image
          ...
    - PhotoDetail
      - SharedView
        - Image
      ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is different. Although a React element has a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;children&lt;/code&gt; prop, it only goes as far as it is declared, not all the way down to all leaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, say we have a React element:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.../&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we try to traverse it only via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;props.children&lt;/code&gt;, we’ll get this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we want to know what’s inside the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/code&gt;, we’d have to instantiate &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/code&gt; and call its &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; method (or if it’s a stateless component defined by a function, we’d call the function). I think that’s pretty much what React does at the “reconciliation” stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;collectActiveSharedViewPairs&lt;/code&gt; function that we were trying to write. All we wanted to do here is to collect shared views in the hierarchy. Doing it via tree traversal is possible, but it sounds wasteful if we have to redo what React is already doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW: I haven’t yet found much about this traversal business. If you know a good resource, or want me to write more about it, say so in the &lt;a href=&quot;#endofpost&quot;&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenge-2-no-direct-access-to-native-widgets&quot;&gt;Challenge 2: No direct access to native widgets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other UI frameworks, such as native Android, we could easily obtain layout information, such as bounding boxes, by calling a few methods on the view object. But this does not work in React Native because we don’t have direct access to native widgets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To understand this, let’s go a bit deeper on how React works. It’s useful to view what’s happening in React as a two-step process:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First, React creates a “virtual tree” that represents the native view hierarchy (which is more famously known as “virtual DOM” in ReactJS). The nodes on this tree, called React elements, are just descriptors – they are plain objects with no references to the native widgets whatsoever. This step is where we, as React developers, can construct and update the user interface: we create React elements to describe what we want, typically in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; methods of components.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then, React takes these descriptors and runs a “reconciliation” step that actually creates and/or updates the native widgets. React handles this process internally and transparently. We have no direct access of this process (and this is where React shines).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;collectAndAnimateSharedViews&lt;/code&gt; is called, we are at the first step above and therefore only have access to React elements. React elements are plain objects and do not have a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getBoundingBox&lt;/code&gt; method or anything remotely related!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about how React works, I recommend &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/12/18/react-components-elements-and-instances.html&quot;&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; by Dan Abramov.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;challenge-3-layout-information-only-comes-after-the-virtual-tree-creation-step&quot;&gt;Challenge 3: Layout information only comes AFTER the virtual tree creation step&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why couldn’t we have this much needed &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;getBoundingBox&lt;/code&gt; method on React elements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is by design. Layout information, such as bounding boxes, is only available when a native widget gets laid out on the screen. However, when we are at the step 1 of the React rendering process, the corresponding native widgets may have not been laid out or even created yet!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why our first attempt of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cloneAndAnimateSharedViews&lt;/code&gt; won’t work!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;solution&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-solution&quot;&gt;My solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what else are on the table? Here’s my approach in a nutshell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Register” shared views on mount:&lt;/strong&gt; Instead of redoing the traversal, we register shared views after they are mounted.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UIManager:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ll wait until the views are laid out before trying to obtain their layout information. Using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;onLayout&lt;/code&gt; props, we call &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIManager&lt;/code&gt; to measure bounding boxes at the right time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we store information such as shared views and bounding boxes as the state of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SharedElementsTransitioner&lt;/code&gt;. This allows us to code in the familiar React paradigm and enable us to take advantage of things like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt; to improve the performance of animations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next let’s check out the code!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;api&quot;&gt;API&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s how a user can mark an element as shared in the component’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;render&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// on photo grid screen&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SharedView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;photo1&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;containerRouteName=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;PhotoGrid&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;source=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// on photo detail screen&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SharedView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;photo1&#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;containerRouteName=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;PhotoDetail&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Image&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;source=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;image&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;SharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;: a name unique across the scene for pairing up the shared views on different scenes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;containerRouteName&lt;/code&gt;: allows us to determine whether a shared view is on the “from” scene or “to” scene.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;register-shared-views-on-mount&quot;&gt;“Register” shared views on mount&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SharedView&lt;/code&gt; looks like. Just take a quick glance and I’ll explain after the code block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SharedView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;contextTypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;registerSharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PropTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;unregisterSharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PropTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;registerSharedView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;registerSharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;containerRouteName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;registerSharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SharedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;containerRouteName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nativeHandle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;componentWillUnmount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;unregisterSharedView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;unregisterSharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;containerRouteName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;unregisterSharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;containerRouteName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;define-registerunregister-functions-in-context&quot;&gt;Define register/unregister functions in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;context&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To save us from the trouble of traversing the tree, we just piggyback on React’s internal traversal – when the shared views are mounted, save it somewhere for later use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose to save the shared views as the state of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SharedElementsTransitioner&lt;/code&gt;. I also used &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;context&lt;/code&gt; to save me from having to pass the register/unregister function all over the place. (To learn more about &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;context&lt;/code&gt;s, read &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/context.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SharedElementsTransitioner&lt;/code&gt;, its child context is defined like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;MaterialSharedElementTransitioner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;childContextTypes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;registerSharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PropTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;unregisterSharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;PropTypes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;getChildContext&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;registerSharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sharedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SharedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;unregisterSharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;containerRouteName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;    
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;itemstomeasure&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;itemsToMeasure&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;registerSharedView&lt;/code&gt;, in addition to saving the shared item to a collection, we also maintain an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;itemsToMeasure&lt;/code&gt; for convenience. This way we’ll know which shared views are “active” and require the bounding box information to create the animation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The implementation of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;registerSharedView&lt;/code&gt; look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// class SharedElementsTransitioner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;registerSharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sharedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SharedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addSharedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sharedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;containerRouteName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sharedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;matchingItem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sharedItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;findMatchByName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;containerRouteName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// schedule to measure (on layout) if another view with the same name is mounted&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;matchingItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prevState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sharedItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prevState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sharedItems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;itemsToMeasure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prevState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;itemsToMeasure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sharedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;matchingItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BTW: We are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-component.html#setstate&quot;&gt;the atomic flavor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; since the new state depends on the previous state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;get-bounding-boxes-with-uimanager&quot;&gt;Get bounding boxes with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIManager&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we do some googling, we’ll find that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIManager.measureInWindow()&lt;/code&gt; is the actual function that we can rely on to get the much needed bounding boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few special things about this function that we need to cope with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It only works after the view is laid out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It works asynchronously.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It requires a “native handle” of the view.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On Android, it’ll return &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; if a view is “collapsed”, an optimization done by React Native.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s address them one by one:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;1-it-only-works-after-the-view-is-laid-out&quot;&gt;1. It only works after the view is laid out.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll just have to call the function at the right time, using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;onLayout&lt;/code&gt; prop of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;React.View&lt;/code&gt;. Note, only &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;React.View&lt;/code&gt; has this prop, so we must wrap the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/code&gt; with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;View&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// class SharedElementsTransitioner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;onLayout=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_onLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_onLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// call UIManager here&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update (2017-02-03):&lt;/strong&gt; This only works on Android. On iOS, the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;onLayout&lt;/code&gt; function isn’t called during transition. This is perhaps more accurate behavior since the layout of the root view does not change during transition. I had to use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;onLayout&lt;/code&gt; on each scene instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_renderScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;transitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;onLayout=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_onLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Scene&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;navigation=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        ....
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;2-it-works-asynchronously&quot;&gt;2. It works asynchronously.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIManager.measureInWindow&lt;/code&gt; returns the result in a callback:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-js&quot; data-lang=&quot;js&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UIManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;measureInWindow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;viewNativeHandle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// do something about x, y, width and height&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the awesome &lt;a href=&quot;https://jakearchibald.com/2014/es7-async-functions/&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;async&lt;/code&gt; function in ES7&lt;/a&gt;, we can write the function in a synchronous fashion. We can also make sure that we only call &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; once until all items are measured:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// class SharedElementsTransitioner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;measure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sharedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SharedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Metrics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Promise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;UIManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;measureInWindow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sharedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nativeHandle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;resolve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_onLayout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toUpdate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Update the state when all metrics are ready&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;toUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;3-it-requires-a-native-handle-of-the-view&quot;&gt;3. It requires a “native handle” of the view.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When registering a shared view, we retrieve its &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/12/18/react-components-elements-and-instances.html&quot;&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ref&lt;/code&gt; prop&lt;/a&gt;, and use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;findNodeHandle&lt;/code&gt; to get the native handle, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;findNodeHandle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;react-native&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SharedView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;ref=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_view&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;componentDidMount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nativeHandle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;findNodeHandle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_view&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;registerSharedView&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SharedItem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nativeHandle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;4-it-returns-undefined-on-android-for-collapsed-views&quot;&gt;4. It returns &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; on Android for “collapsed” views.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Android, React may merge multiple views into a single view to achieve better rendering performance. In this case, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;UIManager&lt;/code&gt; is not able to measure the view anymore and, therefore, returns &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;undefined&lt;/code&gt; in its callback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can ask React to skip this optimization for shared views using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;collapsable&lt;/code&gt; prop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SharedView&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;collapsable=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;children&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;collapsable&lt;/code&gt; doesn’t seem to have any effect on iOS. We can just leave it as is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;improve-rendering-performance-using-shouldcomponentupdate&quot;&gt;Improve rendering performance using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far we’ve been calling &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; in many places:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When registering shared views&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When we finish measuring the bounding boxes of shared views&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When unregistering shared views&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we allow React to update our transitioner on every change, the animation would look miserable, or perhaps no animation all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt; to make sure that we update the transitioner only after we have enough information to create the animation. In fact, we can safely say that, as long as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;itemsToMeasure&lt;/code&gt; isn’t empty, it’s not worth it to update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// when props change, we need to update, as navigationState is in the props&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;itemsToMeasure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-the-animation&quot;&gt;Create the animation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you realize that we haven’t even started on actually creating the animation? All we’ve done so far is preparation. The post is already pretty long though, so let’s leave it to the next post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post we talked about how to collect shared views and how to measure their bounding boxes. We haven’t actually created any animations yet. However, “the journey is the reward” – we’ve learned something about React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My personal takeaways after this project are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;React renders components in a two-step process. We only have control in the first step (and it’s a good thing).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;React elements are plain objects. They are just descriptors, not the real native widgets that draw things on your screen.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;React element trees are shallow. Traversing them isn’t as straightforward as it may sound. We’d need to keep creating React elements along the way by calling &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;render&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the atomic flavor of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/code&gt; if the new state depends on previous state&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;shouldComponentUpdate&lt;/code&gt; to avoid unnecessary component updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next post, we’ll be back to the world of Animated: interpolation, input range, output range etc. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://learnreact.design/2017/01/23/react-navigation-shared-element-transition-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a series of posts about how to create custom transition “views” using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactnavigation.org/&quot;&gt;React Navigation&lt;/a&gt; (based on “NavigationExperiemental”):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/20/navigation-experimental-custom-transition-1&quot;&gt;An overview of Transitioner and CardStack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/22/react-navigation-shared-element-transition-3&quot;&gt;Shared element transition 3/3: the animation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last couple of posts, we’ve learned about how Transitioner/CardStack works and how to create simple transitions by interpolating &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AnimatedValue&lt;/code&gt;s that the Transitioner creates. Now, let’s try something fancier - shared element transition:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;video controls=&quot;&quot; autoplay=&quot;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;source src=&quot;/images/navigation-custom-transition/shared-elements-trimmed-480p.mov&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;source src=&quot;movie.ogg&quot; type=&quot;video/ogg&quot;&gt; --&gt;
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This neat transition was inspired by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://material.io/guidelines/patterns/navigational-transitions.html#navigational-transitions-parent-to-child&quot;&gt;example in the Material design guideline&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll look at an initial implementation which, of course, leaves plenty of room for improvements. And there might be much better approaches. But I think the main points learned via this excise should be useful elsewhere. If you prefer, feel free to dive into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lintonye/react-native-diary/blob/master/transitions/app/MaterialSharedElementTransitioner.js&quot;&gt;the source code&lt;/a&gt;, play with it and come back as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking on it as a personal challenge, I set the following goals before coding:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pure JavaScript&lt;/strong&gt;: Because &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.getexponent.com/good-practices-why-you-should-use-javascript-whenever-possible-with-react-native-26478ec22334#.1f5rqwn1c&quot;&gt;Pure JS is good&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minimal API&lt;/strong&gt;: We’re gonna need a way to tell which views are shared and how they are linked. I wanted to minimize user’s effort for doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reasonably smooth on older devices&lt;/strong&gt;: Of course 60 FPS is the ultimate goal we should all aim at. But realistically it’s hard to achieve on older devices with pure JavaScript. The default CardStack animation sports about 40 FPS on my Nexus 5, which looks reasonably smooth and usable. Let’s use this as a yardstick and see how much further we can improve the performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dissecting-the-animation&quot;&gt;Dissecting the animation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OK, it’s now time to look closely at the animation that we want to create. There are a number of things happening during the 300ms transition window:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The entire photo grid scene first darkens gradually.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The photo thumbnail in the grid is lifted up slightly (by casing a shadow).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The thumbnail then moves, zooms and eventually becomes the bigger photo in the detail scene.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Along with the photo, its container moves and grows until it fills up the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/navigation-custom-transition/shared-element-animation-dissect.png&quot; alt=&quot;Animation dissect&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most interesting part is the No.3 above which creates an effect that the photo jumps out of the grid and expands itself into the detail scene. We’ll devote most of this post to how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;smoke-and-mirrors&quot;&gt;Smoke and mirrors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you really believe that there is a single image being shared between the grid and detail screens?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s reveal the magic trick! The truth: nothing is shared and there is still a separate image on each scene. Most of the animation happens on an extra overlay visible only during the transition. BTW: It’s in fact very difficult, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/brentvatne/hard-react-native-problems/issues/11&quot;&gt;if not impossible&lt;/a&gt;, to share a view across different parts in a component hierarchy in React.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It goes like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the transition is about to start:&lt;/strong&gt; We show the overlay and clone the shared views onto the overlay. The detail scene is rendered but invisible, allowing us to calculate the bounding boxes of the shared views on both of the grid and the detail scenes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;During the transition:&lt;/strong&gt; Using the aforementioned bounding boxes, we animate the cloned views on the overlay.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right after the transition:&lt;/strong&gt; We hide the overlay and show the actual detail scene.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sounds straightforward to implement, right? I thought so in the beginning, however, I had to go through a few iterations to do it properly in the React way, and the asynchronous nature of React Native presents some unique challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s just start coding and see how far we could go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-render-methods&quot;&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;render*&lt;/code&gt; methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still remember how to use Transitioner? Our &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;SharedElementsTransitioner&lt;/code&gt; just renders to a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/code&gt; and defines its &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_render&lt;/code&gt; function like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;SharedElementsTransitioner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;render=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(....)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scenes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scenes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_renderScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;overlay&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_renderOverlay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;prevProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scenes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scenes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;overlay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_render&lt;/code&gt; function is almost the same as that of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CardStack&lt;/code&gt; except for the additional overlay where most of the animations take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_renderOverlay&lt;/code&gt; function should be straightforward too. We just render all the shared views there:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// class SharedElementsTransitioner&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_renderOverlay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(....)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sharedViews&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cloneAndAnimateSharedViews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(....);&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;overlayStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
       &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sharedViews&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;     
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll leave the discussion about this &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cloneAndAnimateSharedViews&lt;/code&gt; method to the next post (as it’s a long discussion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-animated-styles-for-scenes-and-overlay&quot;&gt;Creating animated styles for scenes and overlay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to ensure the overlay to be visible only during transition, we can use the “0.99-cliff” trick discussed in &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/22/navigation-experimental-custom-transition-2#0.99-cliff&quot;&gt;the previous post&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// in _renderOverlay()    //_&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;transitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;100000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// move it off screen after transition is done&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;overlayStyle&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;left&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we chose to animate &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;left&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/code&gt; to prevent the overlay from blocking touch events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, we apply the “0.99-cliff” treatment to scene opacity in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_renderScene&lt;/code&gt; to make sure that the detail scene is initially invisible and only becomes fully opaque when the transition is about to finish. Contrary to the detail scene, the grid scene remains visible during the transition and only becomes invisible right after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// class SharedElementsTransitioner&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_renderScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      ....
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OK, let’s take a break for now. We have discussed a high-level plan on how the shared element transition might work: the overlay is the key to create the shared element effect. We also covered some simpler aspects in its implementation: the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;render*&lt;/code&gt; methods, and how to show/hide scenes and the overlay at the right times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/25/react-navigation-shared-element-transition-2&quot;&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt;, we’ll look into how to actually animate the shared views on the overlay. Bear with me, the fun is still ahead!&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>http://learnreact.design/2016/12/22/navigation-experimental-custom-transition-2</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a series of posts about how to create custom transition “views” using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactnavigation.org/&quot;&gt;React Navigation&lt;/a&gt; (based on “NavigationExperiemental”):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/20/navigation-experimental-custom-transition-1&quot;&gt;An overview of Transitioner and CardStack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simple transitions: cross fade and Android default (this post)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/23/react-navigation-shared-element-transition-1&quot;&gt;Shared element transition 1/3: overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/25/react-navigation-shared-element-transition-2&quot;&gt;Shared element transition 2/3: bounding boxes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/22/react-navigation-shared-element-transition-3&quot;&gt;Shared element transition 3/3: the animation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;update-notes&quot; style=&quot;background: #e8e8e8; padding: 10px; font-size: 0.8em; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update notes (2017-02-01):&lt;/strong&gt; This post was written before the release of React Navigation which will replace NavigationExperimental soon. However, this post is still worth reading since React Native uses core classes in NavigationExperimental. Some minor changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationTransitioner&lt;/code&gt; are now simply &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CardStack&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CardStack&lt;/code&gt; now uses bottom-up transition on Android by default, very similar to the androidDefault animation shown below. That’s a great move.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CardStack&lt;/code&gt; now has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/navigation-prop&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/code&gt; prop&lt;/a&gt; which includes the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; and navigation functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/20/navigation-experimental-custom-transition-1&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we covered how the transition animations in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt; work: the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationTransitioner&lt;/code&gt; creates two &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AnimatedValue&lt;/code&gt;s, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt;, which are then passed to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CardStack&lt;/code&gt; and “interpolated” into style properties such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scaleX&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;translateX&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we’ll take a closer look at how the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/code&gt; are set up in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CardStack&lt;/code&gt; when interpolating the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AnimatedValue&lt;/code&gt;s. We’ll also apply what we learn to create a couple of simple transitions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;display:flex; flex-direction:row;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- crossFade --&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;fivecol&quot; style=&quot;float:none; margin-bottom:20px; &quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;282&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/6_BGrOQQlko?controls=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;!-- androidDefault --&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;fivecol&quot; style=&quot;float:none; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:10px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;282&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/oVwq1QDcnOw?controls=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;sceneindex-and-inputrange&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scene.index&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default “card stack” transition looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fivecol&quot; style=&quot;float:none; margin-bottom:20px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;282&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/cx4MmOV0_M0?controls=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the code of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CardStack&lt;/code&gt;, let’s imagine how we’d implement this ourselves. We’ll use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/code&gt; as an example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we observe closely, we’ll notice that when the photo detail screen moves in, the photo grid screen becomes dimmer and dimmer until totally invisible, whereas the photo detail screen remains opaque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/navigation-custom-transition/cardStack-seq.png&quot; alt=&quot;cardStack seq&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;AnimateValue&lt;/code&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;? It represents the changing index of the scene during the transition. When it transits from the index of photo grid to the index of photo detail, we shall change the opacity of the grid from 1 to 0, and vice versa. Therefore:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// photo grid&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;opacityForGrid&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;indexOfGrid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;indexOfDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// photo detail&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;opacityForDetail&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;indexOfGrid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;indexOfDetail&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is how to figure out &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;indexOfGrid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;indexOfDetail&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s keep going.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we check out &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt;, we’ll see that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_renderScene()&lt;/code&gt; is called with every scene available:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scenes&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scenes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_renderScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_renderScene()&lt;/code&gt; we know the index of the current scene being rendered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_renderScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationSceneTransitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But how do we know whether this &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;indexOfGrid&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;indexOfDetail&lt;/code&gt;? There is a small trick here. We know that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;indexOfDetail&lt;/code&gt; is always &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;indexOfGrid + 1&lt;/code&gt;, so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index === indexOfGrid&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;indexOfDetail = index + 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;if &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index === indexOfDetail&lt;/code&gt;, then  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;indexOfGrid = index - 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using this, we can merge our previous &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;opacityForGrid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;opacityForDetail&lt;/code&gt; into a single &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/code&gt; which can be used to render all the scenes, no matter if it’s the photo grid or detail. Isn’t it beautiful?&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know. What is that “&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index + 0.99&lt;/code&gt;” doing there? Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;0.99-cliff&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;the-099-cliff-trick&quot;&gt;The “&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.99&lt;/code&gt;-cliff” trick&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/navigation-custom-transition/099-trick.png&quot; alt=&quot;opacity code&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The point for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.99&lt;/code&gt; is that it’s &lt;strong&gt;very close&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;. Using them as the input range, we are able to create a “cliff” in the output range. In the example above, when the position changes from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index + 0.99&lt;/code&gt;, the output &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/code&gt; gradually changes from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.3&lt;/code&gt;, and then at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index + 1&lt;/code&gt;, it suddenly sinks to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/navigation-custom-transition/cliff-diagram.png&quot; alt=&quot;opacity code&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cliff, in the card stack transition in particular, is an important performance tuning. Because composing translucent scenes is expensive, we should always try to minimize the number of translucent layers. Here when the photo grid scene is completely covered, we want to set its opacity to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to avoid unnecessary composition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In comparison, the code below suffers from composition overhead because it leaves the opacity of photo grid non-zero even when it’s off screen:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;         &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;     &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.3&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s recap what we’ve learned about the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt; so far:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;inputRange: [index - 1, index, index + 1]&lt;/code&gt;: with this single input range, we are able to express concisely both photo grid and photo detail scenes. If it’s rendering the photo grid scene, the range &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[index, index + 1]&lt;/code&gt; is effective; if it’s rendering the photo detail scene, the range &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;[index - 1, index]&lt;/code&gt; is effective.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.99&lt;/code&gt;-cliff: useful to create output range that “suddenly” changes at some point. &lt;strong&gt;Question:&lt;/strong&gt; what if we want to create a cliff just to the left of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index&lt;/code&gt;? Shall we use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index - 0.99&lt;/code&gt;? Or something else?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;our-very-own-transitions&quot;&gt;Our very own transitions!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we’ve learned about the above, it’s almost trivial to create the transitions I listed at the beginning of this post. I’ll just list the interpolation code below for your viewing pleasure. You can also check out the complete code on github (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lintonye/react-native-diary/blob/master/transitions/app/CrossFadeTransitioner.js&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lintonye/react-native-diary/blob/master/transitions/app/AndroidDefaultTransitioner.js&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.999&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;translateY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;150&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve learned about how to concisely declare input and output ranges for all scenes and the “&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0.99&lt;/code&gt;” trick to create cliffs in the output range. We also created a couple of custom transitions without even breaking a sweat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next post, we’ll start working on something a bit more challenging, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/efPFJkxa-BQ&quot;&gt;shared element transition&lt;/a&gt;! Feel free to ask me questions in the comments below, or suggest topics that you’d like me to write about in future posts. Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/eric.v.vicenti&quot;&gt;Eric Vlad Vicenti&lt;/a&gt; who reviewed this post and provided invaluable feedback!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>React Navigation: An Overview of Transitioner and CardStack</title>
   <link href="http://learnreact.design/2016/12/20/navigation-experimental-custom-transition-1/"/>
   <published>2016-12-20T00:00:00-08:00</published>
   <updated>2016-12-20</updated>
   <id>http://learnreact.design/2016/12/20/navigation-experimental-custom-transition-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a series of posts about how to create custom transition “views” using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactnavigation.org/&quot;&gt;React Navigation&lt;/a&gt; (based on “NavigationExperiemental”):&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;An overview of Transitioner and CardStack (this post)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/22/navigation-experimental-custom-transition-2&quot;&gt;Simple transitions: cross fade and Android default&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/23/react-navigation-shared-element-transition-1&quot;&gt;Shared element transition 1/3: overview&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/01/25/react-navigation-shared-element-transition-2&quot;&gt;Shared element transition 2/3: bounding boxes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/2017/04/22/react-navigation-shared-element-transition-3&quot;&gt;Shared element transition 3/3: the animation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;update-notes&quot; style=&quot;background: #e8e8e8; padding: 10px; font-size: 0.8em; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update notes (2017-02-01):&lt;/strong&gt; This post was written before the release of React Navigation which will replace NavigationExperimental soon. However, this post is still worth reading since React Native uses core classes in NavigationExperimental. Some minor changes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationTransitioner&lt;/code&gt; are now simply &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CardStack&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CardStack&lt;/code&gt; now uses bottom-up transition on Android by default, very similar to the androidDefault animation shown below. That’s a great move.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CardStack&lt;/code&gt; now has a &lt;a href=&quot;https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigators/navigation-prop&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/code&gt; prop&lt;/a&gt; which includes the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; and navigation functions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigation.html#navigationexperimental&quot;&gt;NavigationExperimental&lt;/a&gt; provides great support for custom transition animations. Do you want to create transitions like the following? This series of posts is for you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;display:flex; flex-direction:row;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;!-- crossFade --&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;fivecol&quot; style=&quot;float:none; margin-bottom:20px; &quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;282&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/6_BGrOQQlko?controls=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;!-- androidDefault --&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;fivecol&quot; style=&quot;float:none; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:10px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;282&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/oVwq1QDcnOw?controls=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;!-- materialSharedElement --&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;fivecol&quot; style=&quot;float:none; margin-bottom:20px; margin-left:10px;&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;282&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/efPFJkxa-BQ?controls=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before jumping into it though, let’s first study the built-in container &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt; and see how its transition is implemented. If you are not familiar with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt;, see &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/06/23/navigation-examples-1&quot;&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt; for a simple tutorial on how to use it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;navigationcardstack-in-a-nutshell&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt; in a nutshell&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt;, screens are arranged in a virtual stack of cards. When a new card is brought into the scene, it slides in from either the right or bottom edge of the screen. When it leaves the scene, it slides back to its origin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fivecol&quot; style=&quot;float:none; margin-bottom:20px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;282&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/0e8Irs4gi3M?controls=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0;&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does it work? I dug into its source code and here’s what I’ve found in a nutshell:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/code&gt; library is the backbone of transition animations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt; is backed by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationTransitioner&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationTransitioner&lt;/code&gt; creates and passes along two generic values that describe the transition state: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt; converts these values to the actual visual style properties of the incoming and outgoing screens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s unfold the whole process one step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-premier-on-animated&quot;&gt;A premier on &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/code&gt; is a powerful animation library. As mentioned in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html&quot;&gt;official document&lt;/a&gt;, it “focuses on declarative relationship between inputs and outputs”, like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;0deg&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;360deg&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; is an “&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated.Value&lt;/code&gt;” that represents a generic, high-level state that changes over time. We can then map (interpolate) this value to an actual visual style property (such as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rotate&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever the original value changes, the visual style is updated accordingly. You just need to “wire” the animated values together (defining the mapping), and the rest is taken care of automatically. All this happens without going through the standard, setState-diff-render cycle in React. This removes a lot of overhead to ensure the smoothness of our animations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/code&gt; can be typically used this way:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated.Value&lt;/code&gt; and start the animation when appropriate. This code typically lives in upstream where we just care about a generic state and want to delegate the actual rendering to downstream. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationTransitioner&lt;/code&gt; is a good example of this (we’ll come back to it later).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;timing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}}).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Map the value created above to desired visual style properties, by calling &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;interpolate()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
   &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;0deg&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;360deg&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the visual style properties created above in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated.View&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated.Text&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated.Image&lt;/code&gt; etc.) to render the component:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; ... &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code above will create a view that spins for 500 milliseconds (the default duration).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, I’ve only scratched the surface of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/code&gt; here. For more details, I’d recommend you to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDlfrcM6YBk&amp;amp;t=1333s&quot;&gt;this talk&lt;/a&gt; to see what’s possible, read through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html&quot;&gt;official document&lt;/a&gt;, and check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/react-native-training/react-native-animations-using-the-animated-api-ebe8e0669fae#.p1ngzm78r&quot;&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cardstack-and-transitioner&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CardStack&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Transitioner&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/code&gt;, it’s time to dig into the source code of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be more code than talking from now on. My goal is to provide a guided tour for the source code to make it easier to understand. Only relevant code is shown and the rest are “&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;....&lt;/code&gt;”. It’d perhaps be useful to open the full source on another screen when reading this post.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt; is bascially a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationTransitioner&lt;/code&gt;. Let’s follow along:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationTransitioner&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigationState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;componentWillReceiveProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;nextProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;animations&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;timing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;transitionSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigationState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigationState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;animations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;timing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;transitionSpec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;toValue&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigationState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// update scenes and play the transition&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;parallel&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;animations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_onTransitionEnd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see that two &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated.Value&lt;/code&gt;’s are created: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; simply goes from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; whereas &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; goes from the previous index to the next index of the navigation state. These two values are being animated in parallel. If the index does not change, then only &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; will be animated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it’s time to render, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationTransitioner&lt;/code&gt; simply delegates to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt; function in props:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_transitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_prevTransitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated.Value&lt;/code&gt;’s, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt;, are passed to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt;, as a part of the two parameters &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_transitionProps&lt;/code&gt; and  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_prevTransitionProps&lt;/code&gt;. Here’s how the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;transitionProps&lt;/code&gt; are constructed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_transitionProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;buildTransitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;nextState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;buildTransitionProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;State&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationTransitionProps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we pass &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;props.render&lt;/code&gt; method? Let the implementor of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;props.render&lt;/code&gt; create the actual animations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;interpolating-position&quot;&gt;Interpolating &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you still remember how &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/code&gt; works? We’ll need an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated.View&lt;/code&gt; whose &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;style&lt;/code&gt; prop is an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated.Value&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s safe to guess that there must be something like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position.interpolate()&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt; when it renders the view. Let’s track it down:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-jsx&quot; data-lang=&quot;jsx&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;DefaultProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_renderScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationSceneRendererProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isVertical&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;direction&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;vertical&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isVertical&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStackStyleInterpolator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;forVertical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStackStyleInterpolator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;forHorizontal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;NavigationCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;cardStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationCard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;():&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Element&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;any&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;style=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;styles&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;viewStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;renderScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;View&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each scene is rendered as a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCard&lt;/code&gt;, which is eventually rendered as an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated.View&lt;/code&gt;.  Bingo!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who creates the style for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCard&lt;/code&gt;? It’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStackStyleInterpolator.forVertical()&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;forHorizontal&lt;/code&gt;)!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can then find the secrete sauce that maps (interpolates) &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; to the location, scale and opacity of the cards. Let’s take a quick glance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// NavigationCardStackStyleInterpolator.js&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;forHorizontal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationSceneRendererProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;....&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;layout&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;initWidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;I18nManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;isRTL&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;


  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.95&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mf&quot;&gt;0.95&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;translateY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;translateX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;interpolate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;inputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;outputRange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;translateX&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;translateY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scale&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;translateX&lt;/code&gt; are all interpolations of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; – they’ll change as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; changes. This effectively creates the sliding card animation that we’ve seen earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably have questions about how the input/output ranges are set up in this function, but let’s leave them to the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/12/22/navigation-experimental-custom-transition-2&quot;&gt;next post&lt;/a&gt;, where we’ll also start creating our own transitions soon!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just to repeat a few key points on how the transition animation works in the built-in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated&lt;/code&gt; library is the backbone of transition animations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt; is backed by &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationTransitioner&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationTransitioner&lt;/code&gt; creates and passes along two &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Animated.Value&lt;/code&gt;’s that describe the transition state: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;position&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt; converts these values to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;translateX&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scale&lt;/code&gt; properties of the incoming and outgoing screens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Custom Domains with GitHub Pages</title>
   <link href="http://learnreact.design/2016/06/27/github-pages-custom-domain/"/>
   <published>2016-06-27T00:00:00-07:00</published>
   <updated>2016-06-27</updated>
   <id>http://learnreact.design/2016/06/27/github-pages-custom-domain</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This post is about setting up custom domain names when your site is hosted on GitHub Pages. It’s apparently off-topic on a blog about React Native but I was just surprised by the lack of proper step-by-step guides even on GitHub itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-goal&quot;&gt;The Goal&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Host a website (e.g. this blog) on GitHub Pages (well, it’s free and working great, who can resist that!).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Instead of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;github.io&lt;/code&gt; domain, I’d like to use my own domain name: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reactnativediary.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By default, I’d like to use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; subdomain and redirect the “naked” domain to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; subdomain, that is: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://reactnativediary.com ==&amp;gt; http://www.reactnativediary.com&lt;/code&gt;. This is because GitHub strongly recommends the use of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; subdomain:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It gives your GitHub Pages site the benefit of our Content Delivery Network.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;It is more stable because it is not affected by changes to the IP addresses of GitHub’s servers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Pages will load significantly faster because Denial of Service attack protection can be implemented more efficiently.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;steps&quot;&gt;Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below I’m going to use this blog &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reactnativediary.com&lt;/code&gt; as an example, but of course you can replace it with the info and domain of your own site:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First of all, create a public repo on GitHub named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;react-native-diary-blog&lt;/code&gt;. On its &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch, make sure all the site content is there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gh-pages&lt;/code&gt; branch, create a file named &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; with only one line &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;www.reactnativediary.com&lt;/code&gt;. Note, this file can only include one domain, don’t put multiple domain names here. If you’d like to support multiple domains, you probably want to set up 301 redirects on other domains.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On your DNS provider’s site, create a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;CNAME&lt;/code&gt; record:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;www ==&amp;gt; lintonye.github.io&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the value of your record should be &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io&lt;/code&gt;. See more details &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-www-subdomain/#configuring-a-cname-record-with-your-dns-provider&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. On your DNS provider’s site, create two &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; records for both &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reactnativediary.com&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;www                        192.30.252.153
www                        192.30.252.154
reactnativediary.com       192.30.252.153
reactnativediary.com       192.30.252.154&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: If your DNS provider supports &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ALIAS&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ANAME&lt;/code&gt; records instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; records, see [GitHub’s doc] for details. I don’t personally have any experience in this yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll take a while (in my case a couple of hours) for the DNS setting to take effect. When everything is set up properly, you should be able to see this in the repo’s settings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/github-custom-domain/github-settings.png&quot; alt=&quot;github-settings&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is it. After this setup, GitHub should be able to automatically redirect the “naked” domain (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reactnativediary.com&lt;/code&gt;) to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;www&lt;/code&gt; subdomain. Hopefully you’ll find it more useful than GitHub’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-an-apex-domain/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-www-subdomain/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; pages.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>NavigationExperimental Premier: A Simple Recipe</title>
   <link href="http://learnreact.design/2016/06/23/navigation-examples-1/"/>
   <published>2016-06-23T00:00:00-07:00</published>
   <updated>2016-06-23</updated>
   <id>http://learnreact.design/2016/06/23/navigation-examples-1</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@dabit3/first-look-react-native-navigator-experimental-9a7cf39a615b#.4zl60befe&quot;&gt;Nader Dabit’s post&lt;/a&gt;, I wasted no time when learning about navigation in React Native. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/navigator.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Navigator&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be soon &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ericvicenti/navigation-rfc/blob/master/Docs/NavigationOverview.md&quot;&gt;deprecated&lt;/a&gt; and it will be replaced by a different approach, currently called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationExperimental&lt;/code&gt;. However, I haven’t found much documentation that is easy to follow for a newbie (me) who doesn’t have much experience in Flux, Redux etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to write a simpler tutorial to help myself (and hopefully you too) understand how things work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationExperimental&lt;/code&gt; handles navigation with three things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationState&lt;/code&gt;: exactly as its name says&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationStateUtils&lt;/code&gt;: helper functions for manipulating navigation states&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt;: the container that renders scenes based on its navigation state&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me expand each of these while building some simple navigation like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;fivecol&quot; style=&quot;float:none; margin-bottom:20px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&quot;282&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/enkPGpBBkFE?controls=0&amp;amp;rel=0&amp;amp;showinfo=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;navigationstate&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationState&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ericvicenti/navigation-rfc/blob/master/Docs/NavigationOverview.md#navigator&quot;&gt;proposal (RFC)&lt;/a&gt; of the new navigation system, the old &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Navigator&lt;/code&gt; “owns navigation state and has an imperative API, which goes against the React philosophy of single-directional data flow”. The fix is to define the navigation states declaratively, basically the same way as other things in React: declaring it as a state on the top level component and pass it down in the hierarchy as props.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical navigation state looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// =&amp;gt; index of the active scene&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;routes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// =&amp;gt; navigation stack&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;screen1&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;screen2&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt; is aware of this &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationState&lt;/code&gt; (actually passed in as a prop) and renders scenes accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our simple example app, we can assign the initial navigation state like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavExample&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;routes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;screen1&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the entry of our app is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;screen1&lt;/code&gt;, and there is initially only one screen in the stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BTW: One thing I’m not too sure here - why is the stack called &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;routes&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scenes&lt;/code&gt;? There seems indeed a difference between &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scenes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;routes&lt;/code&gt; if you look at the &lt;a href=&quot;#sceneProps&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sceneProps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; passed into the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;renderScene&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;manipulating-states-with-navigationstateutils&quot;&gt;Manipulating States with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationStateUtils&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now if we click “Go screen2” and then click “Go screen3”, two scenes will be pushed into the stack. The state will look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;routes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;screen1&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;screen2&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;screen3&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point if we hit the “Go Back” button, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;screen3&lt;/code&gt; will be popped off from the stack, making &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;screen2&lt;/code&gt; active (on the top of the stack).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;routes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;screen1&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;screen2&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These stack pushing/popping operations can be done with the helper functions in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationStateUtils&lt;/code&gt; module (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;push()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pop()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jumpTo()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below are the (flow) type definitions of these functions in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/NavigationExperimental/NavigationStateUtils.js&quot;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationRoute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;jumpTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These functions return a new &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationState&lt;/code&gt; which we can use to make the navigation happen by calling &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;this.setState()&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_navigate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// NavigationStateUtils is used in reduceNavState()&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newNavState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reduceNavState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newNavState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;setState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newNavState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here this &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reduceNavState&lt;/code&gt; simply uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationStateUtils&lt;/code&gt; to push or pop routes from the stack, but more complex navigation mechanisms can be implemented as needed (e.g. independent navigation stacks within tabs as in one of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Examples/UIExplorer/NavigationExperimental/NavigationCardStack-NavigationHeader-Tabs-example.js&quot;&gt;official examples&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;reduceNavState&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;action&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;push&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavStateUtils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;pop&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavStateUtils&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navState&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_navigate()&lt;/code&gt; function in hand, it’s now fairly easy to move around in our app, for example, creating a button that links to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;screen2&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Button&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onPress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_navigate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;push&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;screen2&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are not familiar with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bind()&lt;/code&gt;, it’ll create a new function that executes as if we are calling &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_navigate({type: &#39;push&#39;, key: &#39;screen2&#39;})&lt;/code&gt;. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more information about &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;navigationcardstack&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last piece of the puzzle is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt;, a component acting as a container that renders scenes depending on the navigation state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;renderScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_renderScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// a function that performs the rendering&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigationState&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// exactly as its name says&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;renderOverlay&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_renderHeader&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// renders something that&#39;s always on the screen&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onNavigate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_goBack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// this has been renamed to onNavigateBack on master&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;renderScene&lt;/code&gt; function is called, it’ll be provided with a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sceneProps&lt;/code&gt; parameter which looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;sceneProps&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;layout&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;height&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;568&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;initHeight&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;568&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;initWidth&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;360&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;isMeasured&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;width&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;360&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;navigationState&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;index&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;routes&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;key&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;screen1&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;key&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;screen2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;position&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;progress&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;scene&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;isStale&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;key&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;scene_screen2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;route&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;key&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;screen2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;scenes&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;key&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;screen2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of stuff here, but it looks like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;scene.route.key&lt;/code&gt; here refers to the key of the active scene (I’ll update this after they finalize the API). We can then decide what screen to render depending on its value, typically in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_renderScene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sceneProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sceneProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;route&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;key&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;scene&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;screen1&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Screen1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;goScreen2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_goScreen2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;goScreen3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_goScreen3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sceneProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;screen2&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Screen2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;goBack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_goBack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;goScreen3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_goScreen3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sceneProps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;screen3&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course you have the freedom of rendering anything you like, for example, you can do a pattern matching on the route key and render the same screen for a class of scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;support-for-back-button-on-android&quot;&gt;Support for Back button on Android&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Android, there is a Back button that needs some special treatment when implementing navigation. The standard behavior is to go back to the previous screen until the app exits. We can use the &lt;a href=&quot;http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/backandroid.html&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;BackAndroid&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; module to pop up scenes from the stack like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-javascript&quot; data-lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;NavExample&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kr&quot;&gt;extends&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;React&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Component&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;constructor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;props&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;===&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;android&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;BackAndroid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;hardwareBackPress&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;navigation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;index&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;_goBack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
          &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;source-code&quot;&gt;Source Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find the source code of the example app &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/lintonye/react-native-diary/tree/master/NavExamples&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you use React Native 0.28.0+: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;react-native -v&lt;/code&gt;. You can upgrade it using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm install --save react-native@0.28.0&lt;/code&gt; (or the latest version).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here you go, three parts of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationExperimental&lt;/code&gt; work together to complete the story: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationState&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationStateUtils&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;NavigationCardStack&lt;/code&gt;. Navigation states are now good React citizens as they are just normal states or props defined declaratively. This makes the navigation code easier to follow/debug and also open some interesting opportunities, for example, the navigation state can be persisted to the disk during app refreshes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you find this post useful? Do you have other things about navigation to share with us? Chime in below in the comments! Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
