        Linton has built a really great course on React for designers. For one,
        you get the feeling that he's just a nice guy (of course - he's
        Canadian! :) - he doesn't talk down to you in the course or use a bunch
        of needless jargon, and he makes himself available for questions.
        <p>
          He's broken React down into bite-size chunks, using fun graphics and
          animations to illustrate key points (which as visual learners
          designers will appreciate). The course is well thought out and
          structured, including exercises in a coding environment that has
          everything set up for React.

        If learning code is your nemesis like me, you should give Linton‚Äôs
        online course a shot. It helps me make a smooth painless entry to the
        world of coding.
        <p>
          As a UX / UI Designer I need to have understanding on the environment
          where the final product build, not so that I can code them myself, but
          so I can figure out the possibility and features that available so
          that I can design the product better. Being a designer for 30 years
          and never touch a single code, learning to code is my all time
          nemesis, until I found Linton‚Äôs Learn react online course.

        My team at IQVIA was introduced to FramerX as the tool that would bridge
        the gap between designers and the dev team. However, I wasn‚Äôt too
        familiar with React and so I began looking for courses that were simple
        to follow. Most of them required me to have a lot of dev skills.
        <p>
          When I found the Framer + React course from Linton, I was really
          amazed. He explains concepts using simple story analogies and I can
          follow them easily. He also includes sample files with instructions
          how to modify them. Plus, he has small tests at the end of each
          lesson. It was very valuable in gaining knowledge of React and Framer

        Linton really knows how to explain the basics and the essentials of
        programming to non-technical designers like me. His FramerX and React101
        videos show practical examples that helped me tremendously.

        Linton's course empowers designers to help make foundational decisions
        that can make or break web and native apps. React has become ubiquitous
        as a Javascript framework and thanks to this course, I'm more capable
        than ever of building my own products.

        This course is great at explaining react concept with visuals. The
        course is indeed different from other react course, it focusses on
        design more. I feel the combination of video, visuals, quizzes, the
        community help me learning react.

        I learned a lot from Linton‚Äôs React course. It‚Äôs not one of those
        courses where they just let you type along, only explaining the syntax.
        He explains some important concepts and foundamentals very well, makes
        things super clear for people with little programming experience. Thank
        you, Linton!

        helpful.

        I read so many articles about ReactJS, but yours is very understandable
        because of your simple language.
