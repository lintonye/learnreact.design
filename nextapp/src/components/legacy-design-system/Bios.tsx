              I'm a full-stack developer and I love design. I've been teaching
              designers React since 2017 and I'm loving it! I'm also the author
              of a couple of courses at Treehouse and Lynda.
            </p>
            <p>
              My dark little secret: ðŸ˜ˆ creating this course is also my special
              way to learn all things about design and React -- trying to
              explain things clearly has taken my understanding of the concepts
              to a whole new level.
            </p>
            <p>Thrilled to be on this journey with you!</p>

              I'm a designer and animator. I draw inspiration from my dream
              diaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my dreams, I saw mammoths chasing little bears on a circus. I
              managed to turn missiles launched from North Korea into splendid
              firework shows. I convinced the Emperor of Qin Dynasty to stop
              killing. I chatted with Prince Edwards in Chinese. I was left in
              awe by the weirdly breathtaking scenes made up of lily pads,
              lotus, water grass and pale dead fish...
