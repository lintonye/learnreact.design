Remember how Parallax works? We have two components, `ParallaxScroll` and `ParallaxLayer`. `ParallaxScroll` monitors how much the page has been scrolled, finds out all `ParallaxLayer`s in the `children`, calculates their positions based on their `speed` props and the current scroll position, and update their positions.

The code skeleton may look like this:

```jsx
export class ParallaxScroll extends Component {
  ...
  handleScroll = ({x, y}) => {
    // find all ParallaxLayers in this.props.children
    // and update their positions according to x or y
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <Scroll {...this.props} onMove={this.handleScroll}>
        {this.props.children}
      </Scroll>
    );
  }
}
```

But how do we find the `ParallaxLayer`s and update their props? This is the focus of this post.

As mentioned, I've tried three approaches:

1. Clone the `children` tree when scrolling (slooooow!)
2. Use Animatables to avoid excessive cloning (faster)
3. No cloning at all with React Context (awesome!)

Before going through these approaches though, let's visit a mistake that you'd probably make if you are new to React. Honest confession: I did something similar when I started learning React!

## The first attempt

Since `this.props.children` is a tree structure, why can't we just traverse it, find the `ParallaxLayer`s and update the props along the way?

This seems like a straightforward process with recursion:

```jsx
const isParallaxLayer = (node) => ...;

const updateParallaxLayerProps = (node) => ...;

const updateParallaxLayers = (node) => {
  if (isParallaxLayer(node)) {
    updateParallaxLayerProps(node);
  }
  React.Children.toArray(node.props.children).forEach(c =>
    updateParallaxLayers(c)
  );
};
```

In `updateParallaxLayerProps`, perhaps we have something like this, right?

```jsx
node.setProp('style', { left, top })
// or:
node.props.style = { left, top }
```

Unfortunately, there's no `setProp` method and this approach won't work at all. This approach goes against the core ideas of React. In React, props are immutable. We can't update them in-place like so in `updateParallaxLayerProps`!

Heck, if the props in React can't be changed, how do we update our UI? There's certainly something that has to change!

The solution is to create a new copy of the element with the new props:

```jsx
const newNode = React.cloneElement(node, newProps)
```

Here this `cloneElement` function creates a copy of `node` with exactly the same tag name, props and children, except that it'll replace the props included in `newProps`.

We can replace its children as well:

```jsx
const newNode = React.cloneElement(node, newProps, newChildren)
```

We'll then use the `newNode` in the `render` method of the component. This leads to my first approach that actually works (albeit rather slow).

## Approach 1: Clone the tree when scrolling

The code of this approach is on [this branch](https://github.com/lintonye/parallax/tree/approach1-deep-clone-on-render).

### Clone the tree

Because the `children` tree is immutable, if we want to update the props of any element in it, we'd have to clone the entire tree!

```jsx
export class ParallaxScroll extends Component {
  ...
  render() {
    const child = this.props.children[0];
    return (
      <Scroll {...this.props} onMove={this.handleScroll}>
        {this.cloneAndOffsetParallaxLayers(child)}
      </Scroll>
    );
  }
}
```

The `cloneAndOffsetParallaxLayers` method looks like this:

```jsx
cloneAndOffsetParallaxLayers(child) {
  const getUpdatedPositionProps = (node) => {
    if (isParallaxLayer(node)) {
      // return new position props according to scroll position
    } else {
      return null; // won't update props
    }
  }
  return cloneAndUpdateProps(getUpdatedPositionProps, child)
}
```

To make the cloning function reusable, the logic for getting the new props is exacted into the `getUpdatePropsFun` callback function.

The `cloneAndUpdateProps` function uses recursion to clone the entire tree with updated props for each node along the way:

```jsx
function cloneAndUpdateProps(getUpdatePropsFun, node) {
  if (!React.isValidElement(node)) return node
  const updateProps = getUpdatePropsFun(node)
  const clonedChildren = React.Children.map(node.props.children, (c) =>
    cloneAndUpdateProps(getUpdatePropsFun, c),
  )
  return React.cloneElement(node, updateProps, clonedChildren)
}
```

### Update when scrolling

Now let's see how to update the positions of `ParallaxLayer`s when scrolling:

```jsx{4-5}
export class ParallaxScroll extends Component {
  ...
  handleScroll = ({x, y}) => {
    // find all ParallaxLayers in this.props.children
    // and update their positions according to x or y
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <Scroll {...this.props} onMove={this.handleScroll}>
        {this.cloneAndOffsetParallaxLayers(child)}
      </Scroll>
    );
  }
}
```

In the `handleScroll` function above, we'll receive the scroll position `x` and `y`. We can just set it to the state:

```jsx
export class ParallaxScroll extends Component {
  ...
  state = {
    scrollX: 0,
    scrollY: 0
  }
  handleScroll = ({x, y}) => {
    this.setState({scrollX: x, scrollY: y});
  }
  ...
}
```

In the `cloneAndOffsetParallaxLayers` method, we'll use this state to work out the new position props:

```jsx{7-8}
cloneAndOffsetParallaxLayers(child) {
  const getUpdatedPositionProps = (node) => {
    if (isParallaxLayer(node)) {
      ...
      const scrollPosition =
          this.props.direction === "vertical"
            ? this.state.scrollY
            : -this.state.scrollX;
      const left = (scrollPosition * speedX) / 10;
      const top = (scrollPosition * speedY) / 10;
      return {style: {left, top}};
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  }
  return cloneAndUpdateProps(getUpdatedPositionProps, child)
}
```

So that's about it! Whenever the `ParallaxScroll` is scrolled, we'll update the state. As the result, we re-render the whole thing: clone and update the positions of all `ParallaxLayer`s.

I know, this sounds really wasteful. Although the React elements we clone are plain objects which are relatively cheap to create, doing so on every render still doesn't sound like a good idea.

In fact, the scrolling experience of this component looks like this:

## Approach 2: Use Animatable to avoid excessive cloning

The code of this approach is on [this branch](https://github.com/lintonye/parallax/tree/approach2-use-Animatable-to-avoid-render-onScroll).

### Use Animatable

The major issue of the first approach is the excessive cloning that happens whenever the scroll position is updated. In order to get new `left` and `top` props, we have to clone the entire tree because it's immutable. It'd be much faster if we could update the `left` and `top` props of a `ParallaxLayer` in-place, instead of cloning it.

How can we do that while keeping `this.props.children` immutable? The answer is we can't!

In order to improve the animation performance, we'd have to make a compromise to the immutability rule. Framer X provides an `Animatable` that allows us to update its value in-place:

```js
anAnimatable.set(newValue)
```

This is the same idea as `Animated` on React Native that provides high-performance animation on mobile platforms.

So, instead of plain numbers, we'll use `Animatable` for the `left` and `top` props of `ParallaxLayer`. We'd only need to clone the children tree once to replace the `left` and `top` props of all `ParallaxLayer`s:

```jsx{5-9}
cloneAndOffsetParallaxLayers(child) {
  const getUpdatedPositionProps = (node) => {
    if (isParallaxLayer(node)) {
      ...
      const left = Animatable(oldLeft);
      const top = Animatable(oldTop);
      // Keep a record of all layers so that
      // we could update them later on scroll.
      this.layerConfigs.push({left, top, props: node.props})
      return {left, top};
    } else {
      return null;
    }
  }
  return cloneAndUpdateProps(getUpdatedPositionProps, child)
}
```

After that, when the scroll position updates, we can simply update the value of all the `Animatable`s:

```jsx
handleScroll = ({x, y}) => {
  this.layerConfigs.forEach(({left, top, props}) => {
    ...
    left.set(newLeft);
    top.set(newTop);
  })
}
```

This is definitely better than having to re-render and re-clone the entire children tree whenever the scroll position updates.

></iframe>

Oh btw, don't forget to use `Frame` instead of `div` in `ParallaxLayer`. `Frame` knows how to handle `left` and `top` props when they are `Animatable`s whereas `div` does not.

```jsx{1}
import { Frame } from 'framer';
...
class ParallaxLayer extends React.Component {
  ...
  render() {
    return (
      <Frame {...this.props} background={null}>
        {this.props.children}
      </Frame>
    );
  }
}
```

### Performance issue of cloning

Alright, we've significantly reduced the number of re-rendering and cloning. This is definitely an improvement.

However, although we are doing it less frequently now, if the children tree is very deep and complex, it'll take a while for the cloning process to finish. This might freeze the UI and cause a janky experience.

Even worse, Framer X will throw an error in our face if we are trying to clone a big tree:

<img
  src={imgExceedTimeLimitPng}
  alt={`exceeded time limit error`}
  width={588}
  height={562}
/>

That's because Framer X is fairly strict about responsiveness. It only gives components 9ms each frame to finish the rendering.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    We give every component 9ms per frame. For some operations, like mounting
    and rendering children for first time, that is not much. You can use a short
    timer to drive setState() and build up the component in some staggering way.

</blockquote>

This is definitely a bummer. Fortunately, for the use case of Parallax, there's a workaround and we don't have to clone at all! I'll talk about the technique in the next section.

On another note, sometimes we have no choice but to clone. For example, in my other component, [Translate All](https://store.framer.com/package/lintonye/translate-all), I'd have to make changes to components I don't have much control. In order to prevent the "exceeded time limit" error, as [onnlucky](https://twitter.com/onnlucky) mentioned, I'd need to do it in a "staggered way" -- divide the cloning process into small pieces that fit the 9ms window of each frame.

It's possible to clone the children tree with a stack instead of recursion. With a stack, it'd be easier to save the unfinished work and pick up where it's left off on the next frame. This may be a little tricky to implement though. The good news is that the upcoming [time slicing](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html) in React sounds like exactly what we wanted! Hopefully Framer X will update React soon enough when it's available.

## Approach 3: No cloning at all with React Context

The code of this approach on [this branch](https://github.com/lintonye/parallax/tree/approach3-use-context-to-avoid-cloning).

### Why tree traversal if we have full control of `ParallaxLayer`?

The previous two approaches perform a full tree traversal to find out all `ParallaxLayer`s and then clone the entire tree to make changes. This is where the slowness comes in -- if the tree has many nodes, it'd take quite a while to traverse and clone it.

How to avoid tree traversal while still getting hold of all `ParallaxLayer`s?

If we look closely, `ParallaxLayer` is a component we write and we have full control of it. Instead of being passively picked out by the container, why can't a `ParallaxLayer` announce itself voluntarily?

Here's the solution. We can ask a `ParallaxLayer` to register itself when it's mounted, and unregister when it's unmounted. This way, we don't need to traverse the children tree at all!

```jsx
class ParallaxLayer extends React.Component {
  ...
  componentDidMount() {
    // register
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    // unregister
  }
}
```

I'll talk about the details in a bit.

As a bonus, in approach 2 we had to clone the tree to change the `left` and `top` props of `ParallaxLayer` to `Animatable`, remember? In fact, since we have full control of the `ParallaxLayer` component, why can't we just use `Animatable`s in the render method? No funky cloning at all!

```jsx{10-11}
class ParallaxLayer extends React.Component {
  ...
  layerConfig = {
    left: Animatable(0),
    top: Animatable(0),
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <Frame
        left={this.layerConfig.left}
        top={this.layerConfig.top}>
        {this.props.children}
      </Frame>
    )
  }
```

### Pass register functions downwards with React Context

Let's now study the implementation details of the register/unregister functions.

First of all, we'd save information of all the layers to the parent `ParallaxScroll` so that we could access it when the scroll position is updated. It could be a simple array available as a class field:

```jsx
class ParallaxScroll extends React.Component {
  layerConfigs = []
  registerLayer = (layer) => {
    this.layerConfigs.push(layer)
  }
  ...
}
```

But how do we pass this `registerLayer` function to `ParallaxScroll`'s children?

If the children of `ParallaxScroll` were hardcoded as below, it'd be fairly straightforward -- we can just pass the function as a prop:

```jsx
<Scroll>
  <ParallaxLayer register={this.registerLayer} />
  <ParallaxLayer register={this.registerLayer} />
  ...
</Scroll>
```

Unfortunately that is not the case. The code is like this and the `ParallaxLayer`s in the children are added dynamically:

```jsx
<Scroll>{this.props.children}</Scroll>
```

In this case, we can use React Context to pass the register functions downwards.

```jsx
class ParallaxScroll extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <RegisterContext.Provider
        value={{
          registerLayer: this.registerLayer,
          unregisterLayer: this.unregisterLayer,
        }}
      >
        <Scroll {...this.props} onMove={this.handleScroll}>
          {children}
        </Scroll>
      </RegisterContext.Provider>
    )
  }
}
```

In `ParallaxLayer`, we can get the register/unregister functions out of the context this way:

```jsx
class ParallaxLayer extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <RegisterContext.Consumer>
        {({ registerLayer, unregisterLayer }) => {
          // pass registerLayer / unregisterLayer as props
          // to downstream components
        }}
      </RegisterContext.Consumer>
    )
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

So that's it! In this post, we've looked at three approaches of how to find out all `ParallaxLayer`s in the children tree and update their positions. The register/unregister approach with React Context is clearly the winner. It gets the job done without the overhead of cloning the tree.

We should think twice before cloning a children tree because it's potentially costly. Sometimes, we can ask the children to announce themselves voluntarily instead of being picked out passively with a tree traversal.

<!--

### Traverse and update children tree
In `ParallaxScroll`, it's important


```jsx
const cloneAndUpdateProps = (getUpdatePropsFun, node) => {
  if (!React.isValidElement(node)) return node;
  const updateProps = getUpdatePropsFun(node);
  const clonedChildren = React.Children.map(node.props.children, c =>
    cloneAndUpdateProps(getUpdatePropsFun, c)
  );
  return React.cloneElement(node, updateProps, clonedChildren);
};
```
