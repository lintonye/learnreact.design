An introduction to Parallax, a Framer module that makes it easy to prototype advanced scroll interactions.

<!--/excerpt-->

## Introduction

Quick, how do you prototype a page with sticky headers like this in Framer X?

<img
  src={imgStickyScrollGif}
  alt={`gif of sticky header`}
  width={300}
  height={186}
/>

What about this one?

<img src={imgIPhoneXrGif} alt={`gif of iphone xr`} width={205} height={160} />

Or an SVG line tracing animation controlled by scrolling?

<img
  src={imgSvgTracingGif}
  alt={`gif of svg tracing`}
  width={203}
  height={160}
/>

The short answer is: use Linton's Parallax module. :)

I know, shameless plug! But would you say no to a completely free and open source toolkit that saves you a lot of time?

In this post, I'll show you exactly how to build advanced scroll interactions like those above. But they are just seeds, really. The more important thing is that you'd be able to create your own interactions for your own prototypes. What's more, I'll explain how it works under the hood. That'd help you customize and extend the module -- taking its power to the next level!

Are you ready?

## Sticky headers

<img
  src={imgStickyScrollGif}
  alt={`gif of sticky header`}
  width={300}
  height={186}
/>

How do we make something "sticky" on a scrolling page? Moreover, these headers are only sticky when scrolling into a predefined range. If we scroll out of that range, the headers will be back to normal and move with the rest of the content. How do we build that?

Here are the steps:

0. Install [Parallax module](https://store.framer.com/package/lintonye/parallax)
1. Create a Scroll (yes, just the standard Scroll)
2. Write some code overrides
3. Assign the code overrides to the Scroll and the header that's supposed to be sticky
4. Pour yourself a glass of wine, enjoy!🍷

In fact, these are the steps for all the scroll interactions that we're gonna build in this post. Of course, what makes the difference is step 2.

"Just don't tell me that I need to write 200 lines of code!"

Relax! It's easier than you think!

How about this:

```jsx
const overrides = scrollOverrides([0, 200], { id: 'about', op: sticky() })
```

Here, `scrollOverrides` is a function whose first parameter is the range and the second parameter defines the behavior. It literally tells us that we want the header `about` to be sticky when the scroll position is between `0` and `200`, right?

Of course, we need to actually create the code overrides so that we could use them on the canvas:

```jsx
export const Scroll: Override = (props) => overrides.scroll(props)
export const About: Override = (props) => overrides.about(props)
```

This might look a bit different than your typical `onTap` code overrides, but bear with me, I'll explain the format soon.

Also, don't forget to import the `scrollOverrides` and `sticky` functions:

```jsx
import {
  scrollOverrides,
  sticky,
} from '@framer/lintonye.parallax/code/Parallax'
```

Now, if we save the file, we'll be able to see two code overrides `Scroll` and `About`. If we assign them to the Scroll and one of the headers respectively, it'll actually work!

Just a few lines of code. Isn't that nice?

Here's the full code of the sticky headers gif at the beginning of this section. It's no secret, we just use the same pattern a few more times to cover all the headers.

```jsx
import { Override } from 'framer'
import {
  scrollOverrides,
  sticky,
} from '@framer/lintonye.parallax/code/Parallax'

const titleHeight = 81
const overrides = scrollOverrides(
  [422, 696 - titleHeight],
  { id: 'about', op: sticky() },
  [696, 1136 - titleHeight],
  { id: 'portfolio', op: sticky() },
  [1136, 1500 - titleHeight],
  { id: 'contact', op: sticky() },
)

export const Scroll: Override = (props) => overrides.scroll(props)
export const About: Override = (props) => overrides.about(props)
export const Portfolio: Override = (props) => overrides.portfolio(props)
export const Contact: Override = (props) => overrides.contact(props)
```

## iPhone XR page

Let's now look at this baby:

<img src={imgIPhoneXrGif} alt={`gif of iphone xr`} width={205} height={160} />

This prototype is definitely more complex than the last one. We'll study the effects one at a time.

### `modulate`

First, we see the block of text fades away as it's scrolled up, as if it's pushed away by the phone. How do we build that?

You'll know it if you see the canvas:

<img
  src={imgIphoneXrCanvasPng}
  alt={`canvas screenshot`}
  width={530}
  height={400}
/>

On the canvas, we have a frame with a gradient background that covers the text. On the preview, the opacity of this "cover" frame is initially set to 0. The opacity is gradually increased to 1 when scrolling up.

This is how to set the opacity according to the scroll position:

```jsx
const overrides = scrollOverrides(
  [0, 200],
  { id: "cover", op: modulate("opacity", [0, 1]) }
  ...
```

Right! it's the same pattern as `sticky`. Scroll range first, and then the behavior when scrolling into this range. Here, `modulate` is conceptually similar to [`Utils.modulate`](https://medium.com/the-school-of-do/framer-cheat-sheets-utils-modulate-b88e359fdcc6) in Framer Classic. It converts the scroll position into an opacity value between `0` and `1`.

### `speed`

Now let's switch our focus to the phone frame. If we look at it closely, we'll see that the phone moves faster than the rest of the page. This creates the effect that it's popping out from the bottom.

<img src={imgIPhoneXrGif} alt={`gif of iphone xr`} width={205} height={160} />

You guessed right, we have a function to control the speed too! Unsurprisingly, it's called `speed`:

```jsx
;[100, 350], { id: 'iPhoneXR', op: speed(2) }
```

The parameter of `speed` is the speed ratio relative to the rest of the page. We have number 2 here, it means the phone will move twice as fast. If we have number 0, it'll be just normal scroll. Question, what is it gonna look like if we use `speed(-1)`? Try it out!

By the way, did you notice that there's some zooming effect when the phone is moving up? Can you guess how to build it?

`modulate`, right?

```jsx
;[300, 750], { id: 'iPhoneXR', op: modulate('scale', [1.5, 1]) }
```

### Play custom animations

So far, we have `modulate` and `speed` which are both closely tied to the scroll position. If the page scroll a little bit, the values change a little bit. If the page does not scroll, the values won't change. This works great, but sometimes we just want to trigger an animation when the page scrolls into a range. Even when we are NOT scrolling anymore, the animation should keep playing.

The label to the left of the iPhone works like below. Note even when I stopped scrolling (the phone stopped zooming in), the animation continued until the label disappeared.

<img
  src={imgIphoneNameSizeSlowdownGif}
  alt={`iphone name size slowdown`}
  width={410}
  height={320}
/>

We can build it this way:

```jsx{4-6}
  [750, 800],
  {
    op: _ => ({ vy }) => {
      animate.ease(data.phoneNameSizeOpacity, vy > 0 ? 1 : 0, {
        duration: 0.2
      });
    }
  }
```

The highlighted code above runs when the page is scrolled into the given range. Note, it only runs once if we keep scrolling in the same direction.

Here, `data.phoneNameSizeOpacity` is defined in the same code override file just as what we are used to:

```jsx
const data = Data({ phoneNameSizeOpacity: Animatable(0) })
```

For `data.phoneNameSizeOpacity` to work, it is assigned to a code override. But there's a little trick here that I'll explain in a later section.

Also, `vy` is the velocity of the scrolling in the vertical axis. If it's a positive number, the page is scrolling up. If it's negative, the page is scrolling down. We use `vy` to play a different animation according to the scroll direction.

Finally, don't forget the `_ => ` in the front. You'll get an error if you do!

Alright, that's the iPhone XR prototype! There're not much more surprises in the rest of it -- just the same pattern being reused and combined. Check out the [demo file](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6tpjipqxyftbz1v/parallax-webinar.framerx?dl=0) for the complete source code.

## SVG line tracing

<img
  src={imgSvgTracingGif}
  alt={`gif of svg tracing`}
  width={203}
  height={160}
/>

This line tracing effect looks rad, right? How do we build it?

In fact, I've got a `IPadSvg` code component that does most of the heavy-lifting. It exposes a `progress` prop that we can use to control how much the tracing has been done:

<img
  src={imgSvgLineTracingPropertyPanelGif}
  alt={`svg line tracing property panel`}
  width={564}
  height={320}
/>

Since SVG line tracing is not the focus of this post, check out [this article](https://css-tricks.com/svg-line-animation-works/) and the [source code](https://github.com/lintonye/parallax/blob/master/code/SvgTrace.tsx) of `IPadSvg` for more details.

To integrate it with the scroll, we can do this:

```jsx
;[0, 200],
  {
    op: (_) => ({ y }) => {
      data.traceProgress = Math.floor((Math.abs(y) / 200) * 100)
      return true
    },
  }
```

Yup, we use the same way as what I've explained in the "play custom animations" section above. One exception is that we are returning `true` in this function. What's the deal?

Remember? The function only runs once when the page scrolls into the range. But for this prototype to work, we need to continually convert the scroll position into a progress value. Returning `true` here makes sure that the function will run again in the next round.

Of course, don't forget to create a code override and assign it to the component on the canvas:

```jsx
export const Svg: Override = () => ({
  progress: data.traceProgress,
})
```

## Under the hood

Until this point, if you are not satisfied with the "magic" of the Parallax module and start wondering how this stuff works, Kudos! That's a great mindset to have!

I know, perhaps your goal is not to write a Parallax module of your own. Perhaps you just want to build a prototype that rocks. However, don't you want to be the master of your tools? Then you'd better understand how they work!

### What's that `overrides`?

Let's start with this:

```jsx
export const Scroll: Override = (props) => overrides.scroll(props)
```

It's a Framer X code override, right? But normally we write code overrides this way:

```jsx{2-6}
export const Scale: Override = () => {
  return {
    onTap() {
      ...
    }
  }
}
```

What's it? It's an arrow function that returns an object, right? We can rewrite our Scroll override like this:

```jsx{2}
export const Scroll: Override = props => {
  return overrides.scroll(props);
}
```

Compare the highlighted parts in both of the above code snippets. What did you find?

This means `overrides.scroll` is a function that returns an object. In fact, we can print out the result in the console and check out what's actually there.

```jsx{3}
export const Scroll: Override = props => {
  const result = overrides.scroll(props);
  console.log(result);
  return result;
}
```

<img
  src={imgScrollPropsConsolePng}
  alt={`console output`}
  width={650}
  height={188}
/>

Hmm, looks like it's just an object that contains an `onMove` function? Exactly! This is how we monitor the scroll position!

Similarly, if we print out the result of this override:

```jsx
export const About: Override = (props) => overrides.about(props)
```

We'll get:

<img
  src={imgAboutPropsConsolePng}
  alt={`console output about`}
  width={1194}
  height={318}
/>

This time, we create an object that has a `top` Animatable and a `bottom` with `null` value. They override the original `top` and `bottom` -- this is how `sticky` works! (BTW: guess what `left` and `right` are for?)

In fact, we can write the `Scroll` and `About` overrides this way:

```jsx
const data = Data({ aboutTop: Animatable(0) });
export const Scroll: Override = props => {
  return {
    onMove({y}) {
      if (in the range) {
        data.aboutTop.set(-y + initialY) // this is why it's sticky!
      }
    }
  };
}
export const About: Override = props => {
  return {
    top: data.aboutTop,
    ...
  };
}
```

This looks more familiar, doesn't it?

`speed` is a similar story. In fact, `sticky` is just `speed(-1)`! If you don't believe it, check out the [code](https://github.com/lintonye/parallax/blob/master/code/ScrollOverrides.ts#L393). For `modulate`, there's an additional field in the override object depending on the parameter we use. For example, if we call `modulate('opacity', [0, 1])`, we'll have `opacity: data.opacity`.

`scrollOverrides` manages all these override objects, merges and organizes them by id. That's why we have `overrides.scroll`, `overrides.about`, `overrides.iPhoneXR` etc. Each of them is a function that returns an override object.

That's pretty much how it works! With the Parallax module, all we need to do is to define the scrolling behavior, and call `overrides.scroll(props)` or `overrides.about(props)` and so on, the rest of the grunt work is handled by the module.

### Merge overrides

Armed with the knowledge that `overrides.scroll(props)` just returns an override object, we can get back to our earlier [discussion](/2019/02/06/prototyping-advanced-scroll-interactions-in-framer-x#play-custom-animations) about `data.phoneNameSizeOpacity`.

We want to start a custom animation that fades in/out the label when the page scrolls into a range. So we have:

```jsx
;[750, 800],
  {
    op: (_) => ({ vy }) => {
      animate.ease(data.phoneNameSizeOpacity, vy > 0 ? 1 : 0, {
        duration: 0.2,
      })
    },
  }
```

However, this just animates the `data.phoneNameSizeOpacity`. For it to have any effect on the preview, we'd need to create a code override and assign it to the label on the canvas.

```jsx
export const PhoneNameSize: Override = (props) => ({
  opacity: data.phoneNameSizeOpacity,
})
```

But the problem is, we defined another scrolling behavior that make the label sticky:

```jsx
  [500, 1050],
  [
    { id: "phoneNameSize", op: sticky() }
  ],
```

This requires the creation of a code override too!

```jsx
export const PhoneNameSize: Override = (props) => overrides.phoneNameSize(props)
```

How do we make both of them work?

Remind you, what's the return value of `overrides.phoneNameSize(props)`? It's just an object, right?

So, we can just merge them in the way how we merge two objects:

```jsx{2}
export const PhoneNameSize: Override = props => ({
  ...overrides.phoneNameSize(props),
  opacity: data.phoneNameSizeOpacity
});
```

This is the power of knowing what's under the hood!

### Access internal Animatable

Here's another example. Let's say we have a Scroll that "snaps to" a given range. We also want to have navigation buttons that scroll to a location on the page.

<img
  src={imgSnapAndNavigateGif}
  alt={`snap and navigate`}
  width={270}
  height={160}
/>

The snapping behavior can be implemented with the `snap` function in Parallax:

```js
const overrides = scrollOverrides([0, 200], { op: snap() })
export const Scroll: Override = (props) => overrides.scroll(props)
```

It works by overriding the `contentOffsetY` prop of Scroll and animate the value based on the specified scroll range.

However, how do we build the navigation buttons? If we want to scroll to a position on the page, don't we need to update `contentOffsetY` too? This means that we can't simply create a data item to override the `contentOffsetY` of the Scroll.

We can't merge the overrides like the last section either:

```jsx
export const Scroll: Override = (props) => ({
  ...overrides.scroll(props),
  contentOffsetY: data.contentOffsetY,
})
```

In this case, the snapping behavior will stop working because the `contentOffsetY` is overwritten by `contentOffsetY: data.contentOffsetY`.

How do we support both? The answer is in the last section as well: `overrides.scroll(props)` returns an object, which already has a `contentOffsetY` Animatable. Why don't we just use that value for navigation?

```js

let scrollContentOffsetY;

export Scroll: Override = props => {
  const scrollOverride = overrides.scroll(props);
  scrollContentOffsetY = scrollOverride.contentOffsetY;
  return scrollOverride;
}
export NavButton: Override = () => ({
  onTap() {
    animate.ease(scrollContentOffsetY, -500, { duration: 0.3 });
  }
})
```

### Extension opportunities

If you dig deeper, you'd find other opportunities to use Parallax. For example, did you notice that there is a [`scrollAwayHeader`](https://github.com/lintonye/parallax/blob/master/code/ScrollOverrides.ts#L538) function that's built upon `scrollOverrides`?

What about writing a new "op" function that's similar to `sticky`, `speed` or `modulate`? This would definitely be more involved, but what prevents you from reading the [source code](https://github.com/lintonye/parallax/blob/master/code/ScrollOverrides.ts#L267) and learning how to do it?

## Conclusion

Alright, so this is how to prototype advanced, range-based scroll interactions in Framer X. I wrote the Parallax module to help you build great stuff with less time and effort. And I couldn't help writing a bunch of words here about how it works behind the scene, because I believe knowing your tools from inside out really goes a long way.
