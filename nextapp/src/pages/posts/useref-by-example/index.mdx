"React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces." This is the official definition. But what if you are not familiar with JavaScript? Would you still be able to make sense of (and learn) React? My answer is a firm YES.

## Introduction

`useRef` is one of the Hooks that come with React by default. It is also, at least in my experience, one of the most confusing Hooks (perhaps right after `useEffect`). But it's actually a hidden gem. With a good understanding of how it works, it'll become a powerful tool in our arsenal.

What's `useRef` used for? There are two use cases:

1. Directly access DOM nodes. This is the most common use cases of `useRef`. We could use it to obtain the underlying DOM nodes to perform imperative operations. We should actually only do this sparsely.
2. Persist value across re-renders. This is the hidden gem that I'll focus on in this article.

And I'm going to focus on the hidden gem in this article. We are going to use a combination of `useRef`, `useEffect` and `useCallback` to build a like button (click and hold for additional effects):

TODO like button

```jsx
function Editor() {
  const textboxRef = useRef()
  const handleClick = () => {
    textboxRef.current.setFocus()
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" ref={textboxRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

However, the hidden gem actually lies on how it works under the hood. `useRef` simply persists a value across re-renders.

In this post, I'll show you the mental model of useRef, how it works and why we need it, and how to use it in a real-world example. E.g. the like button.

## The mental model

> useRef is like class instance variable for function components.

This single sentence helped me understand it at different levels. But if you are still not sure about what it is, read below.

### The recurring rendering cycles

### Component instance

ref attribute

Class: instance variable

compare with useState: Persist value across re-renders, doesn't trigger re-render

An illustration
usually use with useEffect

<div className="p-8 bg-yellow-100 border border-yellow-400 rounded-sm space-y-4 my-2">
  <p>
    I'm working on a book/course that uses similar approach to teach React -- focus on mental models instead of steps and howtos.

    I believe you'd be able to do useful work with React after a few days of
    learning, <strong>even if you are new to coding</strong>. If you are interested, sign
    up and I'll let you know when the course is ready!

</div>

## Example 1: previous value / state

```jsx
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  const prevCount = useRef()
  useEffect(() => {
    prevCount.current = count
  })

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>
        Prev:{prevCount.current}, Count: {count}
      </h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>+1</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Example 2: stop watch (clear interval)

https://codesandbox.io/s/useref-cancelable-interval-uljky?file=/src/App.js

## Example 3: usePressHoldRepeat

https://codesandbox.io/s/useref-usepressholdrepeat-7megx

## Example 4: useDebouncedState

## Anti-patterns

assign to current in render
use current in jsx
