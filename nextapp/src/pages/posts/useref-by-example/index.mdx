`useRef` is a built-in React Hook. What is it used for? How does it work? I'll reveal this hidden gem for you with a few real-world examples.

<!--/excerpt-->

## Introduction

`useRef` is a built-in React Hook. However, it's one of the most confusing Hooks (at least in my experience). But if you spend some time to learn how it works, you'll see that it's actually a hidden gem 💎, a powerful tool in your arsenal.

I'll reveal this shiny gem <span className="mr-2">💎</span> for you in four steps:

1. What is it used for?
2. The mental model
3. A couple of contrived examples (but they are really helpful for learning)
4. A couple of real-world examples

<div className="flex flex-col space-y-4 justify-center md:flex-row">

  </Demo>
</div>

## What is useRef used for?

There are two use cases.

### Directly access DOM nodes

When combined with the `ref` attribute, we could use `useRef` to obtain the underlying DOM nodes to perform DOM operations imperatively. In fact, this is really an escape hatch. We should only do this sparsely for things that React doesn't provide a declarative API for, such as focus management. If we use it for everything (in theory we could), we'd lose the benefit of [React's declarative programming paradigm](/posts/what-is-react#declarative-ui).

### Persist a value across rerenders

This is what I'm going to focus on in this article. Remember? A hidden gem 💎!

Keep reading 👇.

## The mental model of useRef

Here's the mental model that works for me:

> `useRef` is like class instance variable for function components.

After a lot of struggle trying to understand `useRef`, I finally saw this single sentence. And it clicked! If you are hearing the same clicking sound in your mind right now already, feel free to skip to [the examples section](#example-1-previous-value--state). Otherwise, if you are not familiar JavaScript classes or class instance variables, read on. This section is for you.

### The "rerendering time loop"

To understand how `useRef` works and why we need it, let's get started with a contrived (but useful) example. Can you build a counter without using the `useState` hook?

Let's give it a try:

<LiveEditor>
  {`
function Counter() {
  let count = 0
  // console.log('render')
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col justify-center items-center m-8">
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button
        className="bg-purple-700 px-6 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-purple-500"
        onClick={() => {
          count++
          console.log(count)
        }}
      >
        +1
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
`}
</LiveEditor>

This doesn't work, even though the value of `count` increases on click. Why? React is oblivious to the change of local variables and, therefore, doesn't know when to update the DOM. We'd need to rerender the component, namely request React to call the component function `Counter`, to let the change reflected on the screen.

You can verify this by uncommenting the line `console.log('render')` right after `let count = 0`. The component isn't rendered when the user clicks the button.

OK. Then what if we force the component to render when `count` updates?

<LiveEditor
  highlightLines="2,12"
  scope={{
    useForceRender,
  }}
>
  {`
function Counter() {
  const forceRender = useForceRender()
  let count = 0
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col justify-center items-center m-8">
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button
        className="bg-purple-700 px-6 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-purple-500"
        onClick={() => {
          count++
          console.log(count)
          forceRender()
        }}
      >
        +1
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
`}
</LiveEditor>

This doesn't work either. The count displayed on the page stays zero. Even worse, the count value in the console stopped working too. It's always `1`!

BTW, `useForceRender` above is a custom hook:

<CodeViewer>
  {`
// I know, I used useState below. Didn't I say the example was contrived? :)
function useForceRender() {
  const setC = React.useState(0)[1]
  return () => setC((c) => c + 1)
}
`}
</CodeViewer>

Why? This is what I call **_rerendering time loop_**.

<img src={imgTimeLoop} width={787} height={415} alt="Time loop" />

Every time when the component rerenders, it goes into a time loop. All the local variables in the function will be reset to their original values. That's why `count` is always `0`.

That's no surprise, right? They are local variables defined in the function. When the function reruns, the variables are supposed to behave like that!

As straighforward as this sounds, sometimes it's easy to forget (I do it all the time). So remember, a React component is rerendered all the time, so all the local variables will go into a time loop, over and over again.

Now what if we move the variable out of the component function? It will no longer be affected by the rerendering time loop, right?

<LiveEditor
  highlightLines="1"
  render="<Counter />"
  scope={{
    useForceRender,
  }}
>
  {`
let count = 0
function Counter() {
  const forceRender = useForceRender()
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col justify-center items-center m-8">
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button
        className="bg-purple-700 px-6 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-purple-500"
        onClick={() => {
          count++
          forceRender()
        }}
      >
        +1
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
`}
</LiveEditor>

That's correct! It works! Yay!

### Component instances

But wait a second, what if we want to have two counters?

<LiveEditor
  highlightLines="5-6"
  render="<TwoCounters />"
  scope={{
    useForceRender,
  }}
>
  {`
function TwoCounters() {
  return (
    <div>
      Click both buttons a few times:
      <Counter />
      <Counter />
    </div>
  )
}
//
let count = 0;
function Counter() {
  const forceRender = useForceRender()
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col justify-center items-center m-8">
      <div>{count}</div>
      <button
        className="bg-purple-700 px-6 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-purple-500"
        onClick={() => {
          count++
          forceRender()
        }}
      >
        +1
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
`}
</LiveEditor>

So our counters are still broken. That's because both counters are tied to the same variable `count`. What we need instead is to have a **_separate_** variable for each **_instance_** of the counter.

Introducing `useRef`!

<LiveEditor
  highlightLines="13,17,22"
  render="<TwoCounters />"
  scope={{
    useForceRender,
  }}
>
  {`
function TwoCounters() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Counter />
      <Counter />
    </div>
  )
}
//
function Counter() {
  const forceRender = useForceRender()
  /* 1. Get a "variable" that corresponds to the CURRENT INSTANCE of the component */
  let count = React.useRef(0)
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col justify-center items-center m-8">
      {/* 2. Use the value stored inside the "variable" */}
      <div>{count.current}</div>
      <button
        className="bg-purple-700 px-6 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-purple-500"
        onClick={() => {
          /* 3. Update the value of the "variable" */
          count.current = count.current + 1
          forceRender()
        }}
      >
        +1
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
`}
</LiveEditor>

But, but we are still using that `useForceRender` to update the DOM! If we comment out `forceRender()`, the counter stops working again! (try it)

What's the point of `useRef` if it relies on `useState` to work properly? Why don't we just use `useState`?

What's the point of `useRef` if it doesn't trigger a rerender when the value is updated?

In fact, being able to persist a value across rerenders without triggering another rerender is exactly why `useRef` is created. Sometimes we just don't want the component to rerender when the value is updated.

It's now time to look at a better example.

## Example 1: previous value / state

Let's modify the Counter component. Now we want to display the previous value of the counter whenever the button is clicked. We can do so using a combination of `useState`, `useEffect`, and of course `useRef`.

<LiveEditor highlightLines="3-7">
  {`
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
  const prevCount = React.useRef(0)
  React.useEffect(() => {
    // This runs every time AFTER Counter is rendered.
    prevCount.current = count
  })
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col justify-center items-center m-8">
      <h1>
        Prev: {prevCount.current}, Count: {count}
      </h1>
      <button className="bg-purple-700 px-6 text-white rounded-md hover:bg-purple-500"
        onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>+1</button>
    </div>
  )
}
`}
</LiveEditor>

Look, when saving the previous state in `useEffect`, we definitely don't want the component to rerender. Otherwise, it'd go into an infinite loop. So, `useRef` to the rescue!

<!-- https://codesandbox.io/s/useref-previous-state-hmthe -->

## Example 2: stop watch (clear interval)

Now let's look at a more useful example. How about a stop watch?

<Demo title="Try me">
  <StopWatch />
</Demo>

We can make the stop watch tick with a combination of `useState`, `useEffect` and `setInterval`:

<CodeViewer>
  {`
function StopWatch() {
  const [milliSeconds, setMilliSeconds] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setMilliSeconds((ms) => ms + 1)
    }, 1);
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);
  return ...
}
`}
</CodeViewer>

But how do we pause the stop watch?

We can add another state `paused` and clear the interval when `paused` is `true`. Let's give it a try:

<CodeViewer highlightLines="3,7">
  {`
function StopWatch() {
  const [milliSeconds, setMilliSeconds] = useState(0);
  const [paused, setPaused] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (paused) {
      // 🤔 "interval" isn't defined here
      clearInterval(interval)
    } else {
      const interval = setInterval(() => {
        setMilliSeconds((ms) => ms + 1)
      }, 1);
      return () => clearInterval(interval);
    }
    // BTW: Remember to put "paused" in the deps
  }, [paused]);
  return ...
}
`}
</CodeViewer>

Did you see the problem? Where should we define that variable `interval`?

If we define `interval` in an outter scope, we'll taste the wrath of the rerendering time loop -- `interval` will always be `undefined`.

<CodeViewer highlightLines="4">
  {`
function StopWatch() {
  const [milliSeconds, setMilliSeconds] = useState(0);
  const [paused, setPaused] = useState(true);
  let interval // ❌ interval will always be undefined here
  useEffect(() => {
    if (paused) {
      clearInterval(interval)
    } else {
      interval = setInterval(() => {
        setMilliSeconds((ms) => ms + 1)
      }, 1);
      return () => clearInterval(interval);
    }
  }, []);
  return ...
}
`}
</CodeViewer>

We don't want to put it in state either, since it's really not something we would want to display on the UI. It's interval stuff.

Again, `useRef` to the rescue:

<CodeViewer highlightLines="5,9,12,15">
  {`
function StopWatch() {
  const [milliSeconds, setMilliSeconds] = useState(0)
  const [paused, setPaused] = useState(true)
  // 1. Get the ref that corresponds to the CURRENT INSTANCE of the component
  const interval = useRef()
  useEffect(() => {
    if (paused) {
      // 2. Access the value via ".current"
      interval.current && clearInterval(interval.current)
    } else {
      // 3. Update the value via ".current" too
      interval.current = setInterval(() => {
        setMilliSeconds((ms) => ms + 1)
      }, 1)
      return () => clearInterval(interval.current)
    }
  }, [paused])
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>{format(milliSeconds)}</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setPaused((c) => !c)}>
        {milliSeconds === 0 ? 'Start' : paused ? 'Resume' : 'Pause'}
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
`}
</CodeViewer>

## Example 3: Press and hold to repeat

Let's check out the real thing! Just a reminder, this is what we want to build (remember to click and hold):

<Demo title="Click and hold">
  <LikeButton />
</Demo>

We are going to focus on the press-and-hold behavior:

1. When the mouse is down, wait a little bit;
2. If the mouse is still down after a threshold, say 500 milliseconds, start repeatedly increasing the like count at an interval until the mouse is up;
<!-- 3. It also need to efficiently connect to the backend. We don't want to flood the server with a ton of requests if a user press and hold for a long time. -->

How would we implement this behavior?

In order to detect the press-and-hold gesture, we can use `setTimeout`. When the mouse is down, kick off the timeout. When the mouse is up, clear the timeout.

How do we set and clear the timeout when the component is rendered and rerendered, i.e. when the state `mouseDown` changes?

You already know the answer from Example 2, right? `useRef`!

<CodeViewer>
  {`
function LikeButton(params) {
  const [mouseDown, setMouseDown] = useState(false)
  // 1. Create the ref that track the timeout
  const holdDetectionTimeoutRef = useRef()
  useEffect(() => {
    if (mouseDown) {
      // 2. Set the value of the ref
      holdDetectionTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
        // TODO start increasing like count
      }, 500);
    } else {
      // 3. On a new render, clear the timeout with
      holdDetectionTimeoutRef.current &&
        clearTimeout(holdDetectionTimeoutRef.current);
    }
  }, [mouseDown])
  // set mouseDown in onMouseDown and onMouseUp
  return ...
}
`}
</CodeViewer>

Next, how do we repeatedly increase the like count? `setInterval` is what we need. And of course we'll use another ref to keep track of the interval reference across rerenders.

<CodeViewer highlightLines="10-12,18,23">
  {`
function LikeButton(params) {
  const [mouseDown, setMouseDown] = useState(false)
  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0)
  const holdDetectionTimeoutRef = useRef()
  const intervalRef = useRef(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    if (mouseDown) {
      holdDetectionTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
        // start increasing like count
        intervalRef.current = setInterval(() => {
          setLikes(l => l + 1)
        }, 100);
      }, 500);
      // Don't forget to clear both the timeout and interval
      // in the clean up function of "useEffect".
      return () => {
        holdDetectionTimeoutRef.current && clearTimeout(holdDetectionTimeoutRef.current)
        intervalRef.current && clearInterval(intervalRef.current)
      }
    } else {
      holdDetectionTimeoutRef.current &&
        clearTimeout(holdDetectionTimeoutRef.current);
      intervalRef.current && clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
    }
  }, [mouseDown])
  return ...
}
`}
</CodeViewer>

Finally, we can extract all the logic into a custom Hook `usePressHoldRepeat`:

<CodeViewer>
  {`
function usePressHoldRepeat(
  callback,
  holdDetectionThreshold = 300,
  repeatDelay = 100,
) {
  const [mouseDown, setMouseDown] = useState(false)
  const intervalRef = useRef(0)
  const holdDetectionTimeoutRef = useRef(0)
  const runCallback = useCallback(
    () => typeof callback === 'function' && callback(),
    [callback],
  )
  useEffect(() => {
    if (mouseDown) {
      holdDetectionTimeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
        intervalRef.current = setInterval(() => {
          runCallback()
        }, repeatDelay)
      }, holdDetectionThreshold)
      return () => {
        intervalRef.current && clearInterval(intervalRef.current)
        holdDetectionTimeoutRef.current &&
          clearTimeout(holdDetectionTimeoutRef.current)
      }
    } else {
      holdDetectionTimeoutRef.current &&
        clearTimeout(holdDetectionTimeoutRef.current)
      intervalRef.current && clearInterval(intervalRef.current)
    }
  }, [mouseDown, repeatDelay, runCallback, holdDetectionThreshold])
  return {
    onClick: runCallback,
    onMouseDown: (e) => {
      if (e.button === 0) setMouseDown(true)
    },
    onMouseUp: () => setMouseDown(false),
    onMouseOut: () => setMouseDown(false),
  }
}
`}
</CodeViewer>

When using the `usePressHoldRepeat` hook, remember to use `useCallback` to prevent excess renders due to the fact the function might be recreated on each render (time loop).

<CodeViewer>
  {`
function LikeButton() {
  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);
  const addLike = useCallback(() => setLikes((c) => c + 1), []);
  const props = usePressHoldRepeat(addLike);
  return ...
`}
</CodeViewer>

<!-- ## useDebouncedState
Now what about this requirement:

> 3. It also need to efficiently connect to the backend. We don't want to flood the server with a ton of requests if a user press and hold for a long time.

The expected behavior should be:
1. Send request to the server only at the moment when the mouse is up
2. However, we still want to see the like count being lively updated when the mouse is down. We don't want to delay the visual effect. -->

## Anti-patterns

### Assign to `ref.current` in render

Remember, updating a ref's value is a side effect. We should put it inside `useEffect` or event handlers. Don't update `current` at the top level of a function component.

<CodeViewer>
  {`
function App() {
  let someRef = useRef()
  someRef.current = '❌ Updating a ref is a side effect!'
  useEffect(() => {
    someRef.current = "✅ This is OK"
  })
  const handleClick = () => {
    someRef.current = "✅ This is OK too"
  }
  return ...
}
`}
</CodeViewer>

### Use `ref.current` in JSX and expect it to be reactive

We could use `ref.current` in JSX, as you've seen in [Example 1](#example-1-previous-value--state). However, keep in mind that the value displayed might be stale since updating `ref.current` doesn't trigger a rerender. We need to trigger rerenders in other means, e.g. with `useState`.

<!-- ### Use ref to obtain/update DOM values

We could use ref to obtain the underlying DOM nodes. -->

## Quiz & Related concepts

With the understanding of how `useRef` works, let's look at a few related concepts. I'm going to organize them as quiz questions since I think you'd be able to figure it out with the mental model built after reading this article this far.

Give it a try!

### `ref` and `useRef`

As mentioned, we could use the `ref` attribute and `useRef` to obtain the access to underlying DOM nodes, like so:

<CodeViewer>
  {`
function Editor() {
  /* 1. Call useRef */
  const textboxRef = useRef()
  return (
    <div>
      {/* 2. "Bind" the ref with the input */}
      <input type="text" ref={textboxRef} />
      <button
        onClick={() => {
          /* 3. Access the DOM node via ref.current */
          textboxRef.current.focus()
        }}
      >
        Focus
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
`}
</CodeViewer>

But, have you wondered how it works?

<details className="space-y-4 bg-green-50 border border-green-300 p-4 rounded-sm">
  <summary className="cursor-pointer">Answer</summary>

React receives the ref via the `ref` attribute of `input` and mutates it at some point, just as what we did in the examples above:

<CodeViewer>
  {`
// Somewhere in React code
ref.current = domNode
`}
</CodeViewer>

</details>

### `useRef` vs. `useState`

What is the difference between `useRef` and `useState`? How do they relate to each other?

<details className="space-y-4 bg-green-50 border border-green-300 p-4 rounded-sm">
  <summary className="cursor-pointer">Answer</summary>

Both `useRef` and `useState` persist a value across rerenders of a component. This means the value doesn’t get reset when the component rerenders, whereas all local variables go into a time loop.

The value tracked by `useState` is updated via calling the setter function, which triggers a rerender of the component. In comparison, the value tracked by `useRef` is updated via direct mutation, which does not trigger a rerender.

### `useRef` vs. `createRef`

In React, there's another function called `createRef`:

<CodeViewer>
  {`
const ref = React.createRef()
`}
</CodeViewer>

What is the difference between `useRef` and `createRef`? I know I didn't cover `createRef` so far in the article, but can you guess from its name?

Well. It's called **create**Ref. So every time when it runs, it creates a new ref object.

Hmm... Does that mean `useRef` does NOT create a new ref object every time when it's called?

Exactly! `useRef` only creates a ref object for a particular _component instance_ when it's first rendered. In the following rerenders, it'll just returns the existing ref object associated with that component instance. That's why we can trust it to persist a value across rerenders!

In function components, we should always use `useRef`. `creatRef` is used in class components to create a ref, where we could keep it in a class instance variable (so that it's not created repeatedly when the component rerenders).

## Conclusion

There are two use cases of `useRef`:

1. Directly access DOM nodes to perform DOM operations imperatively
2. Persist a value across rerenders, throughout the full lifetime of a component instance

The second use is particularly powerful when combined with `useEffect`, `useState` and `useCallback`. In this post, we used it in two real-world scenarios:

1. Preserve previous state
2. Preserve the reference of a timeout or interval so that we can clear them at a later time (in another render round)
