## Introduction

The useRef Hook is ...
"What is useRef used for?"
"What is the difference between useRef and createRef?"
preview of the three examples
how to use

## The mental model

ref attribute

Class: instance variable

compare with useState: Persist value across re-renders, doesn't trigger re-render

An illustration
usually use with useEffect

## Example 0: set focus

## Example 1: previous value / state

## Example 2: stop watch (clear interval)

## Example 3: usePressHoldRepeat

https://codesandbox.io/s/useref-usepressholdrepeat-7megx

## Example 4: useDebouncedState

## Anti-patterns

assign to current in render
use current in jsx

## Conclusion
