Look at this React component:

```jsx
function App() {
  return <input />
}
```

It'll render an HTML input in the browser. It's a JavaScript function that returns a value.

But let me ask you, **what does the function actually return?**

...

An HTML `input` tag?

A special `html-tag` value in JavaScript, perhaps similar to a `string`, `number` or `object`?

...

No. Certainly no. In fact, the code above isn't pure JavaScript. It's called _JSX_. It's a format that allows us to write tags that pretend to be HTML and embed them in JavaScript code.

Yes, I said _pretend_. What are those tags really?

Let's reveal the true face of JSX!

## JS In Disguise

JSX tags are JavaScript code in disguise. For example,

```jsx
<input />
```

is equivalent to

```jsx
React.createElement('input')
```

Our component can be rewritten as:

```jsx
function App() {
  return React.createElement('input')
}
```

This makes much more sense, right? In the `App` function, we call the function `createElement` and return the result. The parameter is a string which tells React what kind of _element_ we want to create: an `input`.

With JSX, we can write succinct tags that are both easy to read and write. Under the hood, a tool converts the tags into the corresponding JS code.

Those HTML-ish tags are called _elements_ in React world.

## Why Bother Learning This?

I know. You probably don't plan to work on React itself. Why bother learning things under the hood? Would it help us build apps?

I think it'd help a lot. We don't want to blindly follow a specific format (tags after `return` etc.). We want to make sense of the code. We want to be able to freely express our thoughts. We want to take advantage of language/framework features. With a deeper understanding of what's behind the scene, we can do that.

It's a bit of superpower. Really.

### It's an expression!

Do you know we can assign a tag to a variable?

```jsx
let content = <div>Hey!</div>
```

Or pass a tag around as a function parameter?

```jsx
showAlert(<div>Hello!</div>)
```

Or even print it out?

```jsx
console.log(<input />)
```

Why can we do that?

It's not magic. It's because those tags are just function calls (`React.createElement(...)`). Like any function call, **a JSX tag is a JavaScript expression**. We can put it wherever an expression fits.

By the way, if we print out a tag in the console, it's in fact an ordinary JavaScript object. Again, nothing magical!

```js
Object {type: "input", key: null, ref: null, props: Object, _owner: null}
```

I don't know about you, but I once tried to do this:

```jsx
React.createElement('div').appendChild('input')
```

You know why it doesn't work now, right?

What `React.createElement` creates is a plain object. It's not a DOM node. We can't call `appendChild` on it!

### Debugging

Do you know why we'd get an error for the code below?

```jsx
// import React from 'react';
function App() {
  return <input /> // ❌ Error: React not defined.
}
```

This is a common mistake when we try to write a component in a blank file. The error is much more visible if we convert the tag into JS:

```jsx
// import React from 'react';
function App() {
  return React.createElement('div') // ❌ Error: React not defined.
}
```

### Differences between JSX and HTML

Although JSX tags look like HTML, they are not HTML. In fact, there are quite a few differences between the two. For example, a button in HTML looks like this:

```html
<button onclick="alert('OK')">OK</button>
```

And this is the JSX version:

```jsx
<button onClick={() => alert('OK')}>OK</button>
```

There are two notable differences above. First, the attribute in HTML is all lowercase, whereas in JSX it's camelCase. Second, the attribute values, the parts after `=`, are quite different.

I'll cover the details in the next post. For now, I want you to remember the core reason for these differences: JSX tags are fundamentally JavaScript code.

## Recap

Here's the React mental model covered in this post: a JSX tag is JavaScript code pretending to be an HTML tag. It is:

- a function call
- an expression
- and its value is an object.

Remember this. It might open new doors when you write React code.
