## Overview

What you'll learn:

- Implementing `useTransform` with `MotionValue`
- Arrow functions
- `useSpring`

## `useTransform` to improve `useMotionValue`

Let’s add some improvements to our code here.
Remember `useTransform`? We can use it to make our code a little bit tidier.

We’ll start by importing `useTransform` and creating a couple of MotionValues for our mouse position.

```jsx{3,7-8}
import "./styles.css"

function App() {
  let mouseX = useMotionValue(0)
  let mouseY = useMotionValue(0)
  ...
}
```

For `birdX`, instead of creating a `MotionValue` from scratch, we’ll create one that will change along with `mouseX`.

```jsx{5-6}
function App() {
  let mouseX = useMotionValue(0)
  let mouseY = useMotionValue(0)

  let birdX = useTransform(mouseX, [], [])
  let birdY = useTransform(mouseY, [], [])
  ...
}
```

For the following parameters, we need an input and output range such as the ranges we used in the Tinder Swipe example.

However, this time, let’s try something different. By looking at the `useTransform` [documentation](https://www.framer.com/api/utilities/#usetransform), we can see that there are only **two** parameters when calling `useTransform` in the example on the right. We know that there are only two parameters because there is only **one** comma.

### Arrow Functions

<img src={imgTransformPng} alt={`transform image`} width={509} height={165} />

The first parameter is the source `MotionValue` called `parent` in the documentation and the second parameter is something we'll learn about now!

```jsx
;(value) => value * 2
```

What is this equal sign and greater-than symbol here?

It turns out that it’s just a function. That statement is equivalent to writing this.

```jsx
function(value) {
  return value * 2;
}
```

In context,

```jsx
let birdX = useTransform(mouseX, (value) => value * 2)
```

vs

```jsx
let birdX = useTransform(mouseX, function (value) {
  return value * 2
})
```

The only difference is that one is shorter and looks nicer. I hope you know which one that is!

### How `useTransform` works with `MotionValue`

Let’s look at how this version of `useTransform` works.

```jsx
let birdX = useTransform(mouseX, function (value) {
  return value * 2
})
```

First of all, `useTransform` will create a new `MotionValue` but not from scratch. It uses `mouseX` as a reference, takes out the value from `mouseX`, calls this **anonymous** function, and puts the return value into a new `MotionValue`. To illustrate, if `mouseX` is `100`, `birdX` would be assigned a value of `200`.

Furthermore, whenever the value of `mouseX` changes, the process I just listed would be repeated: the anonymous function is called with the new `mouseX` value and returns the new value into `birdX`.

In our case, we want the return value to be divided by 3.5 and not multiplied by 2.

```jsx
let birdX = useTransform(mouseX, function (value) {
  return value / 3.5
})
```

### Function => arrow function

As you’ve just seen, we can convert the function to a shorter form in a few steps.

1. Removing `function`

   > ```jsx
   > let birdX = useTransform(mouseX, (value) => {
   >   return value / 3.5
   > })
   > ```
   >
   > Because of this **"=>"** sign that looks like a fat >arrow, these kinds of functions are called **arrow >functions**.

2. Removing `()`

   > When there’s only one parameter, we can ignore the >parentheses.
   >
   > ```jsx
   > let birdX = useTransform(mouseX, (value) => {
   >   return value / 3.5
   > })
   > ```

3. Removing `{}` and the `return` statement

   > When a function **only** has a `return` statement, we >can remove the keyword `return` and the curly brackets.
   >
   > ```jsx
   > let birdX = useTransform(mouseX, (value) => value / 3.5)
   > ```

Making the same changes to our other variables,

```jsx{2-8}
let birdX = useTransform(mouseX, value => value / 3.5)
let birdY = useTransform(mouseY, value => value / 3.5)
let cloudsX = useTransform(mouseX, value => value / 8)
let cloudsY = useTransform(mouseY, value => value / 8)
let sunX = useTransform(mouseX, value => value / 10)
let sunY = useTransform(mouseY, value => value / 10)
let bgX = useTransform(mouseX, value => value / 14)
let bgY = useTransform(mouseY, value => value / 14)
```

### `MotionValue` animation

Now, inside of `onMouseMove`, we can remove all our `set` functions and replace them with **two lines**!

```jsx{9-10}
<Frame
  size={550}
  background={null}
  center
  onMouseMove={function(event) {
  let offsetX = event.clientX - window.innerWidth / 2
  let offsetY = event.clientY - window.innerHeight / 2

  mouseX.set(offsetX)
  mouseY.set(offsetY)
  }}
>
```

However, there’s one more issue. The movement of all these image layers now feels a bit stiff.

<img src={imgStiffGif} alt={`stiff animation`} width={242} height={252} />

It no longer has that bouncy effect as our previous solution with `useAnimation`.

<img src={imgBounceGif} alt={`bouncy animation`} width={250} height={242} />

\* Check it out yourself: [Parallax Animation](https://pt866.csb.app/)

This is because, unlike `useAnimation`, `useMotionValue` does not animate with a spring. However, the fix is really simple.

### `useSpring`

If we check out the Framer documentation again, we can find something called [`useSpring`](https://www.framer.com/api/utilities/#usespring).

<img
  src={imgSpringPng}
  alt={`use spring documentation`}
  width={638}
  height={119}
/>

Therefore, instead of importing and calling `useMotionValue`, we'll import and call `useSpring`.

```jsx{3,7,8}
import "./styles.css"

function App() {
  let mouseX = useSpring(0)
  let mouseY = useSpring(0)
  ...
}
```

<img src={imgFinalGif} alt={`final result`} width={238} height={252} />

We now have our spring animation back.

## Conclusion

Now that we know how to use both `useAnimation`, `useMotionValue` and how to convert animation styles, we'll learn about the differences between the two in the next post while we improve our "Tinder" slider!.
