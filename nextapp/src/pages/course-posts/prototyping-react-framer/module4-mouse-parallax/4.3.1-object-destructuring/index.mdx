## Object Destructuring

Do you remember learning about **array destructuring**?

If not, don't worry about it! Array destructuring is a convenient way to extract elements from an array and put the values into variables, all in **one** line.

We previously used array destructuring in our toggle. In fact, we combined it with **variants**.

```jsx{2}
function App() {
  let [mode, cycleMode] = useCycle("off", "on")
  return (
    ...
  )
}
```

Now, let me show you another kind of destructuring that involves extracting values for an **object** instead of an array.

In this `onMouseMove` function, we know the `event` parameter is an **object**, and it has at least two properties, `clientX` and `clientY`.

```jsx{3-5}
<Frame
  ...
  onMouseMove={function(event) {
    let offsetX = event.clientX - window.innerWidth / 2
    let offsetY = event.clientY - window.innerHeight / 2
    ...
  }}
>
  ...
</Frame>
```

Instead of using dot notation over and over again, we can use object destructuring to define variables.

### Array vs object destructuring

Can you guess how to do it? Is it like this?

```jsx
let [clientX, clientY] = event
```

Close! But not quite there yet. For array destructuring, we use **square brackets** since that’s how we define arrays. For objects, we use **curly brackets**!

```jsx
let { clientX, clientY } = event
```

We can now remove `event.clientX` and `event.clientY`.

```jsx{2}
onMouseMove={function(event) {
  let {clientX, clientY} = event
  let offsetX = clientX - window.innerWidth / 2
  let offsetY = clientY - window.innerHeight / 2
  ...
}}
```

### Parameter object destructuring

Even better, we don’t have to define `clientX` and `clientY` here. We can put the destructuring right inside the parameter declaration!

```jsx{1}
onMouseMove={function({clientX, clientY}) {
    let offsetX = clientX - window.innerWidth / 2
    let offsetY = clientY - window.innerHeight / 2
    ...
}}
```

Don’t forget the curly brackets though! When we have the pair of curly brackets, we assume the first parameter is an object and destruct into our choice of variables.

This is why sometimes we see components that have curly brackets inside their parameters.
For example, checking out this code [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/lintonye/prototyping-with-react-framer/tree/4.3.1-slider/app) and scrolling to line **35**, we'll see an example of object destructuring.

```jsx{1}
function Slider({onSlide}){
  ...
}
```

### Embedded object destructuring

Furthermore, we can apply this idea in an embedded way.

From the same [code](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/lintonye/prototyping-with-react-framer/tree/4.3.1-slider/app) as in the example above, scrolling down to line **64** in `handleDrag`, we know `info` and `point` are objects due to the dot notation.

```jsx{3}
function handleDrag(event, info) {
  // change the scale of Skinny’s cheek according to the position of slider knob
  let newScale = transform(info.point.x, [0, 250], [0.4, 1.5])
  animationControls.start({
    scale: newScale,
    transition: { type: "spring", velocity: 0 }
  })
}
```

Can you guess how we could use object destructuring here?

Since `info` is an object, we can extract its `point` property into a variable.

```jsx{1}
function handleDrag(event, {point}) {
  ...
}
```

Additionally, because the value of the `point` property is an object as well, we can extract its properties.

We use a **colon** to indicate that we are now dealing with the value. After that, we use another pair of curly brackets and define a new variable such as `posX`. Then, we can simply use `posX` in our references since `posX` was defined as a variable holding the `x` values.

```jsx{1,3}
function handleDrag(event, { point: { posX } }) {
  // change the scale of Skinny’s cheek according to the position of slider knob
  let newScale = transform(posX, [0, 250], [0.4, 1.5])
  animationControls.start({
    scale: newScale,
    transition: { type: "spring", velocity: 0 }
  })
}
```

All in all, you should be more familiar with object destructing! Additionally, the syntax should look fairly intuitive.

If something is an object, we can use how we define objects to "destruct" or take the value out. In our `info.point.x` case, since `point` was also an object, we further "destructed" to get our desired value. If `x` was also an object, we could continue to destruct.

```jsx
function handleDrag(event, { point: { posX: {xProp} } })
```

## Conclusion

That's object destructuring! It's a convenient way to extract properties into variables!
