## Mouse Events

Let’s add some action to our summer picture.

Similar to our slider example, we want the different elements to move according to the position of the mouse.

We need the `<Frame>` to inform us when the user moves the mouse. At that point, we’ll run some code to create the desired animations.

### Framer's API

Let's check out Framer's API [documentation](https://www.framer.com/api/frame/) and search for `mouse`. Eventually, we will find **`onMouseOut`**. The other mouse events are in conjunction with `onTap` or `onHoverStart` which aren't what we are looking for.

<img src={imgFramerapiPng} alt={`framer api`} width={1154} height={245} />

Even if we cannot find the attribute about mouse movement on this page, Frame supports it in another way. Similar to this `onMouseOut` attribute which standard HTML tags support, **we’ll be able to find relevant information in the React documentation itself**.

Let's click on ["Supported React.Element DOM props"](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#all-supported-html-attributes) then ["SyntheticEvent"](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html)

<img src={imgSyntheticPng} alt={`menu`} width={222} height={90} />

and search for "mouse" again. You should find ["Mouse Events"](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#mouse-events) then click on that.

<img
  src={imgMouseeventsPng}
  alt={`mouse events menu`}
  width={801}
  height={234}
/>

These are the mouse attributes that we can use on a `<Frame>`, `<div>`, and other HTML tags. Specifically, these attributes are called **events**, and they follow a certain pattern.

The name always begins with **"on"**. For example, `onDragLeave`, `onDrop`, `onMouseEnter`, `onMouseMove`,`onMouseOver`, etc.

If we use one of these attributes on a tag, we should set its value to be a **function**. When that event happens, our function will be called. For example, when the user moves the mouse, we can create actions such as playing an animation.

### Implementing `onMouseMove`

Back in our code, we can put `onMouseMove` into the root/parent `<Frame>` and input a function.

```jsx
<Frame
  size={600}
  background={null}
  center
  onMouseMove={function handleMove() {}}
>
  ...
</Frame>
```

### Anonymous Functions

If this function is not intended to be reused somewhere else, we can remove its name.

```jsx{2}
<Frame size={600} background={null} center onMouseMove={
  function (){
    // 1. Find mouse position
    // 2. Create animations
  }
}
>
  ...
</Frame>
```

These kinds of functions are called **anonymous functions**.

### `event` and `info`

If you remember working on the slider, we had an `onDrag` function and we passed `event` and `info` into the function. Let's print out `info` to see if we getting any information.

```jsx
<Frame
  size={600}
  background={null}
  center
  onMouseMove={function (event, info) {
    // 1. Find mouse position
    console.log(info)
    // 2. Create animations
  }}
>
  ...
</Frame>
```

Now when we move our cursor around, we only get a lot of `undefined` print statements.

<img
  src={imgUndefinedPng}
  alt={`undefined console statements`}
  width={281}
  height={178}
/>

This means `info` isn't useful in our case of `onMouseMove`, so we can remove the `info` parameter.

### `event` Properties

Let's go back to React's mouse event [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#mouse-events).

Below, there are a lot of properties we can implement.

<img src={imgPropertiesPng} alt={`properties`} width={302} height={366} />

In our case, there are only two properties we want: `clientX` and `clientY`. These properties are available in the `event` object. We can access `clientX` and `clientY` like this.

```jsx
<Frame
  size={600}
  background={null}
  center
  onMouseMove={function (event) {
    // 1. Find mouse position
    console.log(event.clientX, event.clientY)
    // 2. Create animations
  }}
>
  ...
</Frame>
```

Now we get number outputs in our console.

<img
  src={imgConsolenumbersPng}
  alt={`console number output`}
  width={272}
  height={215}
/>

### Coordinate System

If you observe how the numbers change with your cursor movements, you will notice that they don't follow the traditional coordinate system with **(0,0)** at the bottom left.

If you begin in the **top left** both **x and y will be small**.

Moving to the **top right**, **x will be large** and **y will stay small**.

Moving down to the **bottom right**, **x will stay large** and **y will be large**.

Finally, moving to the **bottom left**, **x will be small** and **y will stay large**.

This coordinate system is hard to intuitively understand at first, but, with enough time, you will get the hang of it!

It might help to think of the position values as the absolute-value offset from the top left corner.

## Conclusion

Now that we have our mouse's x and y position information, we can begin to create animations in our next post!
