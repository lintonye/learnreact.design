# Toggle Part 2

Now we have a `Frame` which is just a blue square, but it’s not that special. It’s just a `<div>`.

## Inspecting the Frame

![frame inspect](./framediv.png)

Inspecting the element reveals that the `Frame` is a glorified `<div>` that allows us to do some cool tricks.

The toggle we are creating is a circle inside a longer shape.

![toggle button](./togglebutton.png)

Because the `Frame` is just a `<div>`, we can put elements inside. Let’s put another `Frame` inside.

## Embedding Frames

```jsx
{
  /* toggle tracker*/
}
;<Frame>
  {/* toggle circle*/}
  <Frame size={60} borderRadius={30} />
</Frame>
```

## Changing Frame Attributes

There should be a circle inside of a larger square now. That larger square will envelop the toggle, so its height should be equal to the circle's diameter (2\*radius), and the width should be around twice the diameter of the circle.

```jsx
<Frame width={120} height={60}>
  <Frame size={60} borderRadius={30} />
</Frame>
```

Our toggle should now look like a circle inside of a rectangle, to make our toggle curved on both sides, we set a `borderRadius` on the outer container as well.

```jsx
<Frame width={120} height={60} borderRadius={30}>
  <Frame size={60} borderRadius={30} />
</Frame>
```

Great! That looks like a toggle now.

## Inspecting the Frame

Let’s look closely at how this works. We’ve set the `width`, `height`, `borderRadius` and size attributes of the Frames.

Remember how a `<Frame>`s is just a `<div>`? However, in HTML, a `<div>`doesn't have these attributes. Therefore, if we try to set them on a `<div>`, there would be no effect. Hence, frames are glorified divs. As a result, we can use these and many other additional attributes on a `<Frame>`.

![inspect of stage 1 of toggle](./togglestage1inspect.png)

We see that the frame works by converting the `width`, `height`, and `borderRadius` attributes into inline styles onto the resulting divs.

## Styling the Frame

Can we style frames with inline styles as if they are divs? Yes. However, the format for setting inline styles in JSX is different from that of HTML.

In HTML, we would do something like

```jsx
<Frame width={120} height={60} borderRadius={30} style="width: 120px">
  {/*SyntaxError with style="width: 120px"*/}
  <Frame size={60} borderRadius={30} />
</Frame>
```

However, we get a `SyntaxError`.

The correct way involves **two** curly brackets!

```jsx{1}
<Frame width={120} height={60} borderRadius={30} style={{width: 120}}>
  <Frame size={60} borderRadius={30}/>
</Frame>

{/*note the JSX style version doesn't need "px"*/}
```

Try removing the `width={120}` attribute and the frame will keep its width due to the style! This `style` attribute also works on divs.

```jsx
<div
  className="App"
  style={{ width: 120, background: 'orange', height: 120 }}
></div>
```

# Conclusion

Therefore, we have two ways to style a Frame.

1. Style attribute.
   > It works on divs and Frames because Frames are divs.
2. Separate attributes such as width, height, borderRadius.
   > They are more convenient but they only work on Frames. They don’t work on divs.

You can find a list of all supported attributes in Framer’s [documentation](https://www.framer.com/api/frame/#layout).

In the next post, we'll learn about strings and objects that are necessary to create our toggle!
