## Overview

What you'll learn:

- Calling functions
- Creating variables with `let` statements
- Assigning variables and compound assignment
- Printing function values and `console.log`
- Embedding Functions as parameters
- Browser function output

## Calling Functions and Variables

Now that we‚Äôve got `sandwichMaker`, how do we use this machine to make sandwiches? The technical term to "activate" the function is named **"calling the function"**.

```jsx
sandwichMaker('ü•ì')
```

Inside the parentheses, we put input in and, in this case, it's bacon! However, we aren't doing anything about the output. We are simply leaving the sandwich there. It is kind of like buying a sandwich maker, making a sandwich and throwing the sandwich away. That's a waste!

Instead, we extract the output by storing it into a variable.

```jsx
let lintonsLunch = sandwichMaker('ü•ì')
```

Now, we will get the output of the sandwichMaker and have a "label" on it. This way hopefully nobody will eat my lunch üëÄ.

The importance of this label is that we can use the output-value later in my code.

Although the sandwich is virtual, and I, unfortunately, can't eat it, we can at least watch and print it. Let‚Äôs do that.

```jsx
let lintonsLunch = sandwichMaker('ü•ì')
console.log(lintonsLunch)
```

<img
  src={imgConsolesandwichPng}
  alt={`sandwich string in console`}
  width={350}
  height={163}
/>

The console is located at the bottom right of the preview page.

The label we used here ‚Äî `lintonsLunch` ‚Äî is called a "variable" in JavaScript and almost every other language.

You can think of it as a labeled bucket that we can put things in.

We define a variable by writing a **`let`**. Followed by the name of the variable, an equals sign, then what we want to put inside the bucket.

```jsx
let variableName = someValue
```

In `sandwichMaker`, the `sandwich` is a variable as well since we put a `let` statement before it. We initialized `sandwich` to a string or, more specifically, a piece of bread!

```jsx
function sandwichMaker(meat) {
  let sandwich = 'üçû'
  sandwich = sandwich + meat
  sandwich = sandwich + 'üçÄ'
  sandwich = sandwich + 'üçû'
  return sandwich
}
```

We can replace the value of a variable anytime with an equals sign.

```jsx
let sandwich = 'üçû'
sandwich = newValue
sandwich = newNewValue
```

### Compound Assignment

```jsx
sandwich = sandwich + meat
```

This line means that we get what‚Äôs currently in the bucket, **concatenate** (adding string) with meat and put the result back into the bucket. It's called a **compound assignment** because a calculation and an assignment is occurring.

#### Shorthand Compound Assignment

A simplified method or more complicated, depending on how you look at it is this

```jsx
sandwich += meat
```

This process repeats until we get a "full sandwich" (adding the veggies and then the final piece of bread) in the variable.

The variable is the third fundamental concept in JavaScript that you should know, along with objects and functions.

### console.log

Now let me ask you, what‚Äôs this console.log? It must be a function because of the pair of parentheses after it, but we didn't define it.

Well, it is a function and although there is a dot here, which I‚Äôll explain later, it is simply another function.

However, it is a bit different than our `sandwichMaker`, since we are not using its return value in any way, but let's try.

```jsx
let lintonsLunch = sandwichMaker('ü•ì')
let output = console.log(lintonsLunch)
console.log(output)
```

<img
  src={imgConsoleundefinedPng}
  alt={`console undefined`}
  width={287}
  height={161}
/>

It looks like some functions do not produce any output, but it does show something on the screen. Functions that don't produce any output can even save something to the disk and more.

<!-- **TODO: Find better analogy** -->

### Embedding Functions as Parameters

By the way, we don‚Äôt necessarily need to save the output of a function to a variable to then put it inside `console.log`.

```jsx
console.log(sandwichMaker('ü•ì'))
```

We can even actually embed more functions calls like this and still get the same output.

```jsx
console.log(microwave(sandwichMaker('ü•ì')))
```

`sandwichMaker` is first run, the output is put it into `microwave` as input, then the output is fed into `console.log`.

<img
  src={imgConsoleheatedPng}
  alt={`console heated sandwich`}
  width={291}
  height={126}
/>

You can also call functions multiple times.

```jsx
console.log(microwave(sandwichMaker('ü•ì')))
console.log(microwave(sandwichMaker('ü•ì')))
console.log(microwave(sandwichMaker('ü•ì')))
console.log(microwave(sandwichMaker('ü•ì')))
```

Now, we simply get four of the same outputs, and we can change the parameters if need be.

All in all, functions are very cool and flexible machines.

### Browser Function Output

Now that we have a sandwich maker function, how do we show the result on the web page, rather than just in the console?

Let‚Äôs say we put it inside a div in `App`. Will we get the same console result?

```jsx
<div className="App">
  <div>sandwichMaker("ü•ì")</div>
  ...
</div>
```

Unfortunately, this doesn't work. I get the literal text inside the `<div>`.

<img
  src={imgSandwichbrowserPng}
  alt={`browser preview of sandwich maker`}
  width={919}
  height={157}
/>

To fix this, we can add a pair of curly brackets to make the code dynamic. These curly brackets will treat what‚Äôs inside as executable code and try to run it. Here it‚Äôll call this function and put the output on the resulting web page.

```jsx
<div className="App">
  <div>{sandwichMaker('ü•ì')}</div>
  ...
</div>
```

Which results in

<img
  src={imgConsolesandwichgoodPng}
  alt={`browser preview of sandwich maker`}
  width={919}
  height={157}
/>

## Conclusion

Great! You now know how to call a function and what variables are! We'll learn next the different types of variables and how to create them.
