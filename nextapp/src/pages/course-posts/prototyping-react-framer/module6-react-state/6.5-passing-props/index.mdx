## Overview

What you'll learn:

- Passing individual props
- Spread operator

<CourseVideoLink to={props.pageContext.frontmatter.video} />

## `RadioGroup` props

<img src={imgRadioPng} alt={`current radio group`} width={131} height={261} />

We are almost ready to make the Radio Group functional, but before that, let's move the radio group to the center of the screen.

If our `<RadioGroup>` was a `<Frame>` then we could add the `center` attribute. Obviously, however, we **can't** do this here since `center` is not supported by `RadioGroup`.

```jsx{5}
function App() {
  ...
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <RadioGroup center choices={options} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

However, since our foundation of our `RadioGroup` is comprised of a `<Frame>`, we can add the `center` attribute there.

```jsx{3}
function RadioGroup(props) {
  return (
    <Frame center background={null}>
      {props.choices.map(choice => (
        <Radio key={choice}>{choice}</Radio>
      ))}
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

### Problem with hardcoding attributes

This certainly works, but it raises an issue. If we set this `center` attribute on the `<Frame>`, every new `<RadioGroup>` will always be centered no matter what. What if we want to have two Radio groups on the page, one centered and one not?

When creating a composnent, we should always think about how it’s going to be used, reused, and what kind of customization it could support.

Instead of giving the base of the `RadioGroup` the `center` attribute, we could add the `center` attribute to the `<RadioGroup>` tag and support it. This way, we can decide whether to center the `<RadioGroup>` or not.

Furthermore, to drive home my point, we might also want to set its position to `relative` or `absolute` in certain cases.

```jsx{5}
function App() {
  ...
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <RadioGroup center position="relative" choices={options} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

We can support these properties this way:

```jsx{3}
function RadioGroup(props) {
  return (
    <Frame center={props.center} position={props.position} background={null}>
      {props.choices.map(choice => (
        <Radio key={choice}>{choice}</Radio>
      ))}
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

However, repeatedly adding many individual props is a tiring and error-prone process. What if we want to support large number of other attributes?

### Spread Operator

We can use the **spread operator** to support all our properties.

```jsx{3}
function RadioGroup(props) {
  return (
    <Frame background={null} {...props}>
      {props.choices.map(choice => (
        <Radio key={choice}>{choice}</Radio>
      ))}
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

If we remove `position="relative"` from our `<RadioGroup>` tag, we'll see that our Radio Group is centered like before.

```jsx{5}
function App() {
  ...
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <RadioGroup center choices={options} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

The spread operator, more specifically, is the three dots `...` before an object.

It takes the object, breaks apart its properties, and spreads them; in our case, taking all the properties of the object and using them to set the attributes of our desired tag.

If our `<RadioGroup>` `props` object is equal to this:

```jsx
props = { center: true, position: “relative” }
```

It would be equivalent to

```jsx{3}
function RadioGroup(props) {
  return (
    <Frame center={true} position="relative" background={null}>
      {props.choices.map(choice => (
        <Radio key={choice}>{choice}</Radio>
      ))}
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

By using the spread operator, we can use all the attributes that the `<Frame>` supports on the `<RadioGroup>` tag.

Try experimenting with the attributes!

## Conclusion

There are multiple ways to pass props, but you should know that with the spread operator you can add as many properties as you want.

We'll continue to dive deeper into understanding and using the spread operator in the next post.
