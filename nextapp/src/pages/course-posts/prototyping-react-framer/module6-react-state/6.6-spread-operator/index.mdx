- Object destructuring and reverse three-dot operator

## Implementing the spread operator

You’ve learned about the **spread operator** which breaks apart an object and uses its properties to set the attributes of a JSX tag.

If we want to write our `RadioGroup` in JavaScript, we use the spread operator in a similar way to JSX.

Since JSX tags are simply JavaScript calls, we can re-write the `<Frame>` of our `RadioGroup` component as follows:

```jsx{3}
function RadioGroup(){
  return(
    React.createElement(Frame, {background: null, ...props}
    , ...
    )
  )
}
```

In the attribute parameter of `createElement` we can place the spread operator right inside the curly brackets when we construct an object. Don't forget to use a comma when separating parameters!

All in all, the spread operator takes an object, breaks apart all its properties, and spreads them around in a new object.

To illustrate, let's use the console for our next example.

### Spread operator syntax

Copy and paste this piece of code:

```jsx
person = { name: 'Linton', age: Infinity }
```

We are creating an object called `person` which has two properties, `name` and `age`.

After we press return, we can use the `person` object to construct a new object.

Let's type this statement inside our console:

```jsx
{ hobby: "Lie about his age", ...person }
```

After we press return again, we'll get a new object with a `hobby` property and all of the `person` object's properties: `name` and `age`.

<img
  src={imgHobby2Png}
  alt={`hobby properties in console`}
  width={488}
  height={187}
/>

Furthermore, the parameter position/order of the spread operator, `...person` matters!

For example if we type this into the console,

```jsx
{ age:0, ...person }
```

The `person` object's `age` property is overrides `age:0` because the spread operator is last.

Vice versa:

```jsx
{...person, age:0 }
```

This time, `age:0` overrides the `person` object's properties.

<img src={imgAgePng} alt={`age property`} width={407} height={180} />

Therefore, we can conclude that whatever appears last in parameter order has the final say.

### Object destructuring and Spread operator

The three-dot operator can be used together with object destructuring as well. In fact, it is very common.

```jsx{3}
function RadioGroup(props) {
  return (
    <Frame background={null} {...props}>
      {props.choices.map(choice => (
        <Radio key={choice}>{choice}</Radio>
      ))}
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

### Problem with using `{...props}`

In our case, we are using `...props` here to forward the `RadioGroup` attributes to the Frame. Although it works, we can pass too many properties to the `<Frame>` tag. For example, when using `...props` we are also passing on `choices` to the `<Frame>`. However, since `choices` is not an attribute supported by Frame, we just don't see it, but to be efficient and clear, how can we choose a property to exclude from being passed on?

#### Object destructuring

If you remember, with object destructuring, we can replace `props` in our `RadioGroup` parameter with an object.

```jsx{1,4}
function RadioGroup({choices}) {
  return (
    <Frame background={null} {...props}>
      {choices.map(choice => (
        <Radio key={choice}>{choice}</Radio>
      ))}
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

This change assumes the parameter to be an object, extracts the `choices` property, and defines a new variable of our choice, in which we named, `choices`.

We can now change `props.choices` to `choices`, but now `...props` is undefined.

### Reverse three-dot operator

How can we capture the rest of the properties?

```jsx{1,3}
function RadioGroup({choices, ...rest}) {
  return (
    <Frame background={null} {...rest}>
      {choices.map(choice => (
        <Radio key={choice}>{choice}</Radio>
      ))}
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

The `rest` object will have all the properties of the original parameter except the `choices` property.

As a reminder, object destructuring allows us to create new variables. Therefore, we can name them however we like.

```jsx{1,3-4}
function RadioGroup({optionChoices, ...newProps}) {
  return (
    <Frame background={null} {...newProps}>
      {optionChoices.map(choice => (
        <Radio key={choice}>{choice}</Radio>
      ))}
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

Unlike our previous examples, the three-dot operator is working the opposite way. Instead of breaking apart properties, it is collecting the rest of them and assembling them into a new object.

## Conclusion

Alright, that’s a short summary about the spread operator. It is commonly used in modern JavaScript due to how convenient the spread operator is.

In the next post, we'll add a React State to our `RadioGroup` and make it finally functional!
