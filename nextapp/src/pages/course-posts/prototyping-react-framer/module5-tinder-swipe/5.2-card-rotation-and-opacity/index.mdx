## Overview

What you'll learn:

- Implementing rotation
- `useTransform` with `MotionValue`
- `useTransform` input and output ranges
- `opacity` with `MotionValue`

## Rotation using `MotionValue`

Now let’s make this swipe gesture a bit more realistic. We’ll rotate the card counter-clockwise when we drag it to the left and rotate it to the other direction when we drag it to the right.

Replacing `y={mv}` with `rotate={mv}`,

```jsx{5}
<Frame
  center
  drag="x"
  x={mv}
  rotate={mv}
  dragConstraints={{ left: -200, right: 200 }}
  style={style}
/>
```

<img src={imgRotateGif} alt={`rotating card`} width={258} height={210} />

Perhaps you can invent some new interaction by exploring these attributes!

However, don’t get distracted yet. We want to create the tinder swipe first!

As a result, the card shouldn’t rotate this much.

To do that, we need to convert the x offset range to a smaller range of rotation degrees.

### `transform`

We did something similar to that in our Slider. The function `transform` was used to do this conversion.

Using `transform`, we only need to give it a value, an input range, and an output range.

Unfortunately, the `transform` function cannot be used here. If you check out its [documentation](https://www.framer.com/api/utilities/#transform), the value being transformed must be a number.

<img
  src={imgInputPng}
  alt={`transform function documentation`}
  width={661}
  height={129}
/>

Scrolling down,

<img
  src={imgValuePng}
  alt={`inputValue must be a number`}
  width={472}
  height={66}
/>

### `useTransform`

The good news is that the Framer library gives us something similar to `transform` for MotionValues. It’s another hook called `useTransform`.

On the same Framer documentation page, we can click on `useTransform` on the left menu to see its [documentation](https://www.framer.com/api/utilities/#usetransform).

Let's take a look at the second example first. We'll go over the first one later.

<img
  src={imgUsetransformPng}
  alt={`useTransform function`}
  width={672}
  height={426}
/>

Although the first parameter is called `parent`, we can see that the function takes an input range the gives an output range.

To use `useTransform` we first have to import it.

```jsx{3}
import "./styles.css"
```

### Rotating our card

We can then call `useTransform` inside our `App` component. Since the dragging range of the card is between `-200` and `200`, from our `dragConstraints`, we have the input range.

```jsx{3}
function App() {
  let mv = useMotionValue(0)
  let rotateMv = useTransform(mv, [-200, 200], [-50,50])
  ...
```

Then instead of `rotate = {mv}`, we replace that with `rotate = {rotateMv}`.

```jsx{5}
<Frame
  center
  drag="x"
  x={mv}
  rotate={rotateMv}
  dragConstraints={{ left: -200, right: 200 }}
  style={style}
/>
```

<img src={imgRotatemvGif} alt={`less rotation card`} width={260} height={212} />

That works pretty well.

## Card `opacity`

Similarly, we can create another `MotionValue` for the **`opacity`** of the card. This will make the card fade away when we drag it.

```jsx{4}
function App() {
  let mv = useMotionValue(0)
  let rotateMv = useTransform(mv, [-200, 200], [-50,50])
  let opacityMv = useTransform(mv, [-200, 200], [1, 0])
  ...
```

Then in our `<Frame>`,

```jsx{6}
<Frame
  center
  drag="x"
  x={mv}
  rotate={rotateMv}
  opacity={opacityMv}
  dragConstraints={{ left: -200, right: 200 }}
  style={style}
/>
```

<img src={imgOpacity1Gif} alt={`opacity demo`} width={258} height={210} />

However, this isn’t quite what we wanted. The card is supposed to be opaque when it’s sitting in the middle and disappear when we swipe it to the left or the right.

We can solve this by fixing our input and output ranges.

Since the input and output ranges in `useTransform` are arrays, we can put more than just two elements inside. As long as the number of input and output ranges match, Framer will treat them as **keyframes**.

### Adjusting input and output array ranges

When the card is sitting in the middle, its x offset is 0, so let's add `0` to our input range.

```jsx{4}
function App() {
  let mv = useMotionValue(0)
  let rotateMv = useTransform(mv, [-200, 200], [-50,50])
  let opacityMv = useTransform(mv, [-200, 0, 200], [1, 0])
  ...
```

When the x offset is `0` we want the opacity to be 1, so let's move the `1` in our output range to the middle. We can do this by adding a `0` to the output array because we also want our card to fade when we drag it to the left.

```jsx{4}
function App() {
  let mv = useMotionValue(0)
  let rotateMv = useTransform(mv, [-200, 200], [-50,50])
  let opacityMv = useTransform(mv, [-200, 0, 200], [0, 1, 0])
  ...
```

<img src={imgOpacity2Gif} alt={`opacity both sides`} width={260} height={214} />

If you think the card disappears too soon, we can insert more "keyframes" to fine-tune the animation.

```jsx{4}
function App() {
  let mv = useMotionValue(0)
  let rotateMv = useTransform(mv, [-200, 200], [-50,50])
  let opacityMv = useTransform(mv, [-200,-150, 0, 150, 200], [0, 1, 1, 1, 0])
  ...
```

<img
  src={imgOpacityslowGif}
  alt={`opacity slowed down`}
  width={260}
  height={212}
/>

## Conclusion

This is it! We can build this swipe gesture with the Framer library in just a few lines of code. It’s a lot of fun to play with different attributes and watch how the frames would change. I highly encourage you to try a few more things, and really, unleash your creativity!

In the next post, we'll revisit our summer parallax module and learn how to convert the animation to incorporate `useMotionValue`.
