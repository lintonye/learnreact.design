## Finishing our Card Swipe

Let’s complete our swipe prototype.

Currently, our card always bounces back to its original position no matter how far we swipe it.

<img src={imgBouncebackGif} alt={`bounce back`} width={344} height={246} />

We want to change it so that if we swipe the card far enough, it’ll keep moving until it disappears. Otherwise, if we only move it a little bit, it’ll bounce back to the original position.

How can we change the code to make that happen?

Currently, in `onDragEnd`, we always start the animation that moves the `x` offset of the card to `0`.

```jsx
<Frame
  ...
  onDragEnd={function() {
    animControls.start({ x: 0 })
  }}
/>
```

We need to add a **conditional** here to start a different animation according to how far we have swiped.

How would we determine if the card has been swiped far enough? We’ve done something like this before!

We can get more information about the drag gesture from the parameters of this function. The first parameter is `event`, the second one is `info`.

```jsx
<Frame
  ...
  onDragEnd={function(event, info) {
    animControls.start({ x: 0 })
  }}
/>
```

We can get how far we’ve dragged the card using the parameter `info`. Therefore, we don't need the `event` parameter.

However, if we simply remove the `event` parameter, our "info" variable will really be equal to `event` because the first parameter is `event` and the second is `info`.

Try switching `info` and `event` while using them., and you'll see that the order of parameters is extremely important.

### Underscore parameter

To solve this, we can change `event` into an **underscore** **`_`** .

```jsx
<Frame
  ...
  onDragEnd={function(_, info) {
    animControls.start({ x: 0 })
  }}
/>
```

There’s nothing special about this underscore. It’s a parameter as well, but we usually use it as a placeholder for parameters that we don’t care in the function.

Back to `info`, since it's an object, we can get the `x` offset using `info.point.x`. We can now write our `if` statement.

```jsx
<Frame
  ...
  onDragEnd={function(_, info) {
    if (info.point.x < 150){
      animControls.start({ x: 0 })
    } else {
        animControls.start({x:200})
    }
  }}
/>
```

However, there is still a problem with this. When we drag to the left, the card still bounces back. This occurs because, on the left, the `x` offset will turn negative.

<img src={imgRightGif} alt={`right disappear`} width={342} height={246} />

How do we account for both directions?

### `Math.abs`

Well, there are many ways. For example, we could add multiple if and else statements, but the simplest method here is to use the **absolute value** function in the **Math library** that comes with JavaScript — `Math.abs`.

```jsx
<Frame
  ...
  onDragEnd={function(_, info) {
    if (Math.abs(info.point.x) < 150){
      animControls.start({ x: 0 })
    } else {
      animControls.start({x:200})
    }
  }}
/>
```

The original problem isn't completely fixed yet, but now the card follows the `else` code path. Instead of disappearing on the left side, the card quickly moves to the right side.

<img
  src={imgLeftproblemGif}
  alt={`left problem still`}
  width={344}
  height={248}
/>

This occurs because when we move the card to the left enough, the absolute value of the negative value is greater than 150. Therefore, the code in the `else` statement is run.

To fix this, we can add another conditional that tests if the `x` offset is negative or positive.

```jsx{7-11}
<Frame
  ...
  onDragEnd={function(_, info) {
    if (Math.abs(info.point.x) < 150){
      animControls.start({ x: 0 })
    } else {
      if (info.point.x <0){
        animControls.start({x:-200})
      } else {
        animControls.start({x:200})
      }
    }
  }}
/>
```

<img src={imgLeftGif} alt={`left side working`} width={344} height={248} />

### Ternary Operator

We can make our code more elegant by using a **ternary operator**. Instead of this nested if-else statement, we can write something like this:

```jsx{7}
<Frame
  ...
  onDragEnd={function(_, info) {
    if (Math.abs(info.point.x) < 150){
      animControls.start({ x: 0 })
    } else {
      animControls.start({x: info.point.x < 0 ? -200 : 200})
    }
  }}
/>
```

#### Creating a ternary operator

There are **5** main components.

1. Condition

   > The condition is the boolean comparison inside the parentheses of an `if` statement.
   >
   > ```jsx
   > info.point.x < 0 ...
   > ```

2. Question mark: `?`

   > You can think of `?` as the end of the condition.
   >
   > ```jsx
   > info.point.x < 0 ? ...
   > ```

3. First value

   > This is the value after the question mark. It will be accessed if the condition is true.
   >
   > ```jsx
   > info.point.x < 0 ? -200 ...
   > ```

4. Colon: `:`

   > You can think of `:` as the keyword `else`.
   >
   > ```jsx
   > info.point.x < 0 ? ...
   > ```

5. Second value
   > This is the value after the colon. It will be accessed if the condition is false.
   >
   > ```jsx
   > info.point.x < 0 ? -200 : 200
   > ```

In total, a **ternary operator** is a condensed version of an if-else statement.

## Conclusion

We now have finished creating the "Tinder" swipe with one card. Along the way, you learned about rotation, opacity, `useMotionValue`, and `useAnimation`, arrow functions, `_`, `Math.abs`, the ternary operator, and more.

In the following posts, we add more cards to make a final result like this!
