## Overview

What you'll learn:

- `start` function
- `Promise`

## Padlock animation bug

Our padlock animation code works quite well! Although `await` and `async` are relatively new terms and concepts, our code looks fairly straightforward.

As a reminder, if we want to wait for an animation to complete, we can begin the statement of code with `await`.

However, have you wondered why the previous code did not work?

Although code is executed one by one from top to bottom, removing the `await` seems to cause these two lines of animation to run at the same time.

```jsx{6,8}
<Frame
  background={null}
  width={100}
  onTap={async () => {
    // 1. lift up
    shackleAnim.start({ y: -30 })
    // 2. rotate
    shackleAnim.start({ rotateY: 180 })
  }}
  {...props}
>
```

If we add multiple `console.log` statements in `onTap` they will run from top to bottom and certainly not simultaneously.

Therefore, what's going on in our animation `start` functions?

Well, the computer still runs these two lines one by one, top to bottom.

### Simultaneous?

The `start` function handles animation in a special way. It only starts the animation, but it doesn't wait for its completion.

Essentially, the first line of animation begins and after a very short moment, the second animation starts.

Since the the delay between the two is negligibly small, we don't notice it. As a result, we perceive what's going on as simultaneous.

### `start`

We can dig deeper into how the start function works by printing out the result of the function call.

```jsx{6}
<Frame
  background={null}
  width={100}
  onTap={async () => {
    // 1. lift up
    console.log(shackleAnim.start({ y: -30 }))
    // 2. rotate
    shackleAnim.start({ rotateY: 180 })
  }}
  {...props}
>
```

In our console, the start function seems to return a value called **`Promise`**.

<img src={imgPromisePng} alt={`promise console`} width={269} height={111} />

### `Promise`

You can think of a `Promise` as a receipt when ordering fast food such as McDonalds!

With it, you can get your food when it’s ready, leave your food at the counter for a bit, or run an errand while the food is being prepared.

Although `promise`, `await`, and `async` seem to be specialized for animations, we can use these terms in many other scenarios. You’ll see more examples in later modules.

I'll "promise" you that if a function returns a `Promise`, by default, it’ll return a result extremely quick.

However, this result is **only** a receipt, not the execution of the animation.

## Conclusion

All in all, you should know that to use `await` you must also use `async` and the start function returns something called a `Promise` which is akin to a food receipt. At this point, `async` is quite an advanced topic, so we'll skip over that for now.

In the next post, we'll create the failed unlock animation!
