- Creating a padlock animation

## Orchestrated Animations Intro

Welcome to the Animation Orchestration module!

Weâ€™ll learn how to create a sequence of animations, staggered animations, and JavaScript concepts such as **async** and **await**.

Using that knowledge, we'll build multiple animations like these:

### Padlock

<img src={imgPadlock2Gif} alt={`Padlock Animation`} width={224} height={190} />

See for yourself! [Padlock Animation](https://gtyux.csb.app/).

### Failed Unlock

<img
  src={imgUnlockfailedGif}
  alt={`Failed Unlock Animation`}
  width={300}
  height={165}
/>

See for yourself! [Failed Unlock Animation](https://n52pw.csb.app/).

### Floating Action Button (FAB)

<img src={imgFab2Gif} alt={`Floating Action Button`} width={127} height={281} />

## Padlock Animation

Here is the link to the starter [code](https://github.com/lintonye/prototyping-with-react-framer/tree/7.1-padlock-animation-starter/app).

```jsx
function Padlock(props) {
  return (
    <Frame background={null} width={100} {...props}>
      <Frame background={null} left={5}>
        <Shackle />
      </Frame>
      <Frame background={null} top={60}>
        <Body />
      </Frame>
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

We have a `Padlock` component that includes a few frames.

If you remember, the three dots before `props` is the spread operator.

It allows us to pass along props from the `<Padlock>` tag to the `<Frame>`.

Inside, we have a frame that wraps `<Shackle />` and another frame that wraps `<Body />`.

```jsx{2,5}
<Frame background={null} left={5}>
  <Shackle />
</Frame>
<Frame background={null} top={60}>
  <Body />
</Frame>
```

### SVG

`Shackle` and `body` are simply SVG's, Scalable Vector Graphics, but their properties are written in JSX syntax.

In an SVG file, their properties are not written with JSX format. Therefore, we need to convert properties such as `stroke-linecap` to `strokeLinecap`.

As a result, these SVG's are not those that we can copy directly from design tools. Remember that JSX has a **camel-case** syntax.

### SVG to JSX

To make these SVG-to-JS conversions easier for us, there are many online tools. In particular, there is a free website called [svg2jsx.com](https://svg2jsx.com/).

<img src={imgSvg2JsxPng} alt={`svg2jsx website`} width={800} height={376} />

Back in our code,

We currently have `Shackle `and `Body` as separate components.

```jsx{2,5}
<Frame background={null} left={5}>
  <Shackle />
</Frame>
<Frame background={null} top={60}>
  <Body />
</Frame>
```

In order to add animations, there are each wrapped inside a `<Frame>`. Therefore, it's also straightforward to adjust their positions.

Now when the lock is tapped, we want to do a couple of things: lift up and rotate.

### `onTap`

Let's add the `onTap` property and give it a function value.

```jsx{7-10}
function Padlock(props) {
  return (
    <Frame
      background={null}
      width={100}
      {...props}
      onTap={function() {
        //1. Lift up
        // 2. Rotate
      }}
    >
      ...
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

How are we going to control the animation of another Frame using `onTap`?

`useAnimation`!

### `useAnimation`

Make sure `useAnimation` is imported.

Then, in `Padlock` we'll call `useAnimation`.

```jsx{2,13}
function Padlock(props) {
  let shackleAnim = useAnimation()
  return (
    <Frame
      background={null}
      width={100}
      {...props}
      onTap={function() {
        //1. Lift up
        // 2. Rotate
      }}
    >
      <Frame background={null} left={5} animate={shackleAnim}>
        <Shackle />
      </Frame>
      <Frame background={null} top={60}>
        <Body />
      </Frame>
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

### Common Error

Make sure your attributes such as `animate` are written correctly because unlike other errors, we won't get a warning or error if we misspell an attribute.

Your code may look perfect, but your prototype may not work at all!

### Animating `Shackle`

To lift the shackle we'll animate the `y` attribute.

```jsx
function Padlock(props) {
  let shackleAnim = useAnimation()
  return (
    <Frame
      background={null}
      width={100}
      {...props}
      onTap={function () {
        //1. Lift up
        shackleAnim.start({ y: -30 })
        // 2. Rotate
      }}
    >
      ...
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

<img src={imgShackleGif} alt={`shackle lift up`} width={224} height={177} />

### Rotating `Shackle`

Now, we just have to rotate `Shackle`. However, we have to know what version of `rotate` we want since there is `rotate`, `rotateX`, `rotateY`, and `rotateZ`.

Because we want our shackle to swivel on the Y-axis, we'll choose `rotateY`. Try experimenting with the other rotations to see what they do.

```jsx{12}
function Padlock(props) {
  let shackleAnim = useAnimation()
  return (
    <Frame
      background={null}
      width={100}
      {...props}
      onTap={function() {
        //1. Lift up
        shackleAnim.start({ y: -30})
        // 2. Rotate
        shackleAnim.start({ rotateY: 180 })
      }}
    >
      ...
    </Frame>
  )
}
```

However, there seems to be a problem with our code.

<img src={imgOriginGif} alt={`rotation`} width={257} height={178} />

The origin of our rotation seems to be off.

To fix this, we can add the `originX` attribute to our `Shackle` `<Frame>`.

```jsx{1}
<Frame background={null} left={5} animate={shackleAnim} originX={0.41}>
  <Shackle />
</Frame>
```

Despite this, our result is not exactly what we wanted to create.

<img src={imgBadpadlockGif} alt={`bad padlock`} width={223} height={177} />

The shackle is lifted and rotated at the same time, but we want it to lift first and then rotate it afterward like this:

<img src={imgPadlock2Gif} alt={`padlock`} width={224} height={190} />

How do we wait for the completion of the first animation before starting the second one?

### `await`

In pseudocode, we want our code to look similar to as follows:

```jsx
wait for shackleAnim.start({ y: -30}) then run  shackleAnim.start({ rotateY: 180 })
```

However, there is one word in our pseudocode that can be essentially used to do what we want!

If we turn `wait` to `await`, codesandbox or your code editor should color code `await`.

`await` is a special keyword which will allow the first animation to finish then run the second!

```jsx{7}
<Frame
  background={null}
  width={100}
  {...props}
  onTap={function() {
    //1. Lift up
    await shackleAnim.start({ y: -30})
    // 2. Rotate
    shackleAnim.start({ rotateY: 180 })
  }}
>
```

### `async`

We get a `SyntaxError`, but we can fix this by adding `async` right before our anonymous function.

```jsx{5,7}
<Frame
  background={null}
  width={100}
  {...props}
  onTap={async function() {
    //1. Lift up
    await shackleAnim.start({ y: -30})
    // 2. Rotate
    shackleAnim.start({ rotateY: 180 })
  }}
>
```

Our padlock animation works as expected now!

<img src={imgPadlock2Gif} alt={`padlock`} width={224} height={190} />

We call our function an **async function** now. Inside **async functions** we can utilize `await`.

`async` and `await` will also work with arrow functions.

This works for arrow functions as well.

However, this time, we keep the parentheses.

```jsx{5,7}
<Frame
  background={null}
  width={100}
  {...props}
  onTap={async () => {
    //1. Lift up
    await shackleAnim.start({ y: -30})
    // 2. Rotate
    shackleAnim.start({ rotateY: 180 })
  }}
>
```

This will work exactly as before.

## Conclusion

Look how simple that was! We created a seemingly complicated set of animations using a few lines!

In the next post, we'll take a closer look at why our previous method didn't work.
