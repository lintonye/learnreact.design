## Overview

What you'll learn:

- Structure of how a website's user-interface works
- Inspect element to see behind-the-scenes of websites
- What does source code look like?

## Websites

When we visit websites such as Google, Instagram, and countless others we see an aesthetic user interface.

<img src={imgSocialMediaJpg} alt={`social media`} width={1440} height={843} />

But how do they work?

### How websites work

Take Google for example, this is the HTML code that makes up the page. The browser, in conjunction with other code, creates the appealing design we see.

<img
  src={imgGoogleInspectPng}
  alt={`looking at google's html with inspect element`}
  width={1303}
  height={917}
/>

Since web design is all about what the users see, a local copy of the code is downloaded by every user viewing the site. As a result, we can change the code around! Fortunately, this won't affect the millions of other users or else the internet as we know it would be terrible!

### Inspect Element

#### Right click and choose inspect element

<img
  src={imgGoogleInspect2Png}
  alt={`changing google inspect elmement`}
  width={1307}
  height={918}
/>

We can also see the JavaScript code on this page.

<img
  src={imgGoogleInspect3Png}
  alt={`viewing google's JavaScript`}
  width={1311}
  height={918}
/>

This is what makes the page interactive. By typing in the search box, I'll get a list of suggestions. This is powered by JavaScript.

<img
  src={imgGooglesearchPng}
  alt={`google search bar`}
  width={611}
  height={488}
/>

However, if that JavaScript code is what the developers write and read, they would be superhuman! In reality, the messy code above is prepared and optimized for web browsers â€” not for people. The code developers use is far more legible and useable.

<img
  src={imgGoogleInspect2Png}
  alt={`changing google inspect elmement`}
  width={1307}
  height={918}
/>

## <span>CodeSandbox.io</span>

We will be using codesandbox.io, an online code editor.

The code that developers use is called **source code** and looks more like this.

<img
  src={imgCodesandboxPng}
  alt={`legible code developers use`}
  width={1703}
  height={949}
/>

It's the literal source code, with formating for readability, that the browser sees and interprets. We are going to write this kind of code to instruct the browser for our purposes.
