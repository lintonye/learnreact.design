## Overview

What you'll learn:

- `info` parameter
- Dot notation concerning objects
- `console` object

## `onDrag` `info` parameter

To make the slider work properly, we need to change the scale of Skinny’s cheek according to the position of the slider.

If we check out the Framer API [documentation](https://www.framer.com/api/frame/#draghandlers.ondrag),
there are two parameters for the `onDrag` function — in our case, `handleDrag` — `event` and `info`. The second one, `info`, is what we need.

We can extract the x position of the slider with the info parameter using `info.point.x` as we can see on the right-hand side of the API page.

Before explaining what this dot notation is, let’s just print out `info` in our code to see what it actually is. We first add the 2 parameters to `handleDrag` then `console.log(info)`.

```jsx{2,4}
function App(){
  function handleDrag(event, info) {
    // change scale of Skinny's cheeks according to slider knob position
    console.log(info)
  }
  return (
    ...
  )
}
```

Now if we start dragging, we'll see a huge amount of objects printed out. This tells us that `info` is an object. If we expand the object in our console (click the small arrow), you can see four properties: `point`, `delta`, `offset`, and `velocity`.

<img src={imgInfoPng} alt={`info object in console`} width={662} height={154} />

### Dot notation

Further expanding `point` since we can see it as an object as well, it has two properties `x` and `y`. Therefore we can use the dot notation to get specific property values from an object.

```jsx{4}
function App(){
  function handleDrag(event, info) {
    // change scale of Skinny's cheeks according to slider knob position
    console.log(info.point)
  }
  return (
    ...
  )
}
```

<img
  src={imgPointPng}
  alt={`point object in console`}
  width={379}
  height={128}
/>

Now `point` objects are printed out in the console. We can then add a `.x` to get our final x position values that we need to update the scale of Skinny's cheek.

```jsx{4}
function App(){
  function handleDrag(event, info) {
    // change scale of Skinny's cheeks according to slider knob position
    console.log(info.point.x)
  }
  return (
    ...
  )
}
```

<img src={imgPointxPng} alt={`point x in console`} width={268} height={174} />

### `console`

Now, can you explain the `log` behind `console`? Why do we use the dot here?

First of all, `log` is a function and we put a pair of parentheses after it to call it. This is something we’ve seen before.

However, why do we use the dot here? Well, `console` is an object too! And `log` is one of its properties whose value is a function.

To verify this, we can print out the console and check it inside the console.

```jsx{4}
function App(){
  function handleDrag(event, info) {
    // change scale of Skinny's cheeks according to slider knob position
    console.log(console)
  }
  return (
    ...
  )
}
```

<img
  src={imgConsolePng}
  alt={`console object in console`}
  width={951}
  height={114}
/>

We see that `log` is a property with a function value! In fact, almost everything in JavaScript is an object.

## Conclusion

I mentioned earlier that computer languages are very logical. If some code is written in a certain way and pattern, there must be a reason. Once you understand the logic, it is straightforward to apply it to new code. You don’t need to rely on raw memorization too much.

For example, if there is an object, we can use the dot notation to extract its property value. We can chain the dot notation like in `info.point.x` because up to `x`, the `info.point` property is an object!

When you see some other people’s code, I encourage you to ask yourself questions like what I just did and use `console.log` to understand the underlying logic.

In the next post, we'll can finally have our slider affect Skinny.
