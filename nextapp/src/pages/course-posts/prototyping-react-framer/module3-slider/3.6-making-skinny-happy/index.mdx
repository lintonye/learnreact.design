## Overview

What you'll learn:

- `transform` function
- `animationControls`
- `useAnimation`

## Animating Skinny

Now that we have the position of the slider knob available as `info.point.x`, we can finally try to make Skinny happy. That is, we want to change the `scale` of Skinny’s cheek according to `info.point.x`.

Let's look closer at the `info.point.x` values that the `console` prints. We begin at `0` and end at `220`.

We can’t directly use the value of `x` as the scale of Skinny’s cheek. Otherwise, he’d be very mad when his face is 220 times puffier! We need to convert `x` into a smaller range.

When x is 0, we set the scale to 0.4, when x is 220, we set the scale to 1.5, when x is somewhere in-between, the scale should be between 0.4 and 1.5.

### `transform`

We could work out the math, but the Framer library provides a good utility for this. Back to our import statements, we want to import `transform`.

```jsx{3}
import "./styles.css"
```

`transform` is a function. Let's call it right before printing `info.point.x`. We first give it our current value, `info.point.x`, then the input range in an array form `[0, 220]`, and then the output range in an array `[0.4, 1.5]`.

We can now initialize a variable called `scale` to save the `transform` return value.

```jsx{4-5}
function App(){
  function handleDrag(event, info) {
    // change scale of Skinny's cheeks according to slider knob position
    let newScale = transform(info.point.x, [0, 220],[0.4, 1.5])
    console.log(info.point.x, newScale)
  }
  return (
    ...
  )
}
```

Printing both `info.point.x` and `newScale`, separated with a comma, gives us this.

<img
  src={imgConsolescale2Png}
  alt={`console x position and scale`}
  width={254}
  height={131}
/>

Now the question is how to get the scale value out from the handleDrag function and set it to Skinny's cheek Frame.

### `animationControls`

We could directly set the `scale` attribute in that frame to some variable.

```jsx{8}
{/* Cheek */}
<Frame
  background="url(https://cdn.glitch.com/071e5391-90f7-476b-b96c-1f51f7106b0c%2Fcheek.png)"
  width={79}
  height={67}
  left={155}
  top={135}
  scale={someVariable}
/>
```

However, we want some animation when the `scale` value changes. Therefore, we’ll use the `animate` attribute.

Usually we do this:

```jsx{8}
{/* Cheek */}
<Frame
  background="url(https://cdn.glitch.com/071e5391-90f7-476b-b96c-1f51f7106b0c%2Fcheek.png)"
  width={79}
  height={67}
  left={155}
  top={135}
  animate={{ scale: 0.5}}
/>
```

But here we’ll use a new thing called `animationControls`.

```jsx{8}
{/* Cheek */}
<Frame
  background="url(https://cdn.glitch.com/071e5391-90f7-476b-b96c-1f51f7106b0c%2Fcheek.png)"
  width={79}
  height={67}
  left={155}
  top={135}
  animate={animationControls}
/>
```

Looking at the Framer animate [documentation](https://www.framer.com/api/frame/#animationprops.animate)

<img
  src={imgAnimatePng}
  alt={`animate documentation`}
  width={515}
  height={67}
/>

the `animate` attribute can have three different controls, **AnimationControls**, **TargetAndTransition** which we used for our toggle, and **VariantLabels** which we also used.

We get an error since `animationControls` is not defined yet.

We’ll define it this way.

```jsx{3,7}
import "./styles.css"

function App(){
  let animationControls = useAnimation()
  function handleDrag(event, info) {
    // change scale of Skinny's cheeks according to slider knob position
    let newScale = transform(info.point.x, [0, 220],[0.4, 1.5])
    console.log(info.point.x, newScale)
  }
  return (
    ...
  )
}
```

### `useAnimation`

We import `useAnimation`. Then since `useAnimation` is a function because of the parentheses, we get its return value, and assign it to `animationControls`. Now that there are no errors, we can begin our animation with `animationControls.start({scale: newScale})`.

```jsx{5}
function App(){
  let animationControls = useAnimation()
  function handleDrag(event, info) {
    let newScale = transform(info.point.x, [0, 220],[0.4, 1.5])
    animationControls.start({scale: newScale})
  }
  return (
    ...
  )
}
```

What’s `animationControls`? And why can we use dot notation?

`animationControls` is an object with a property called `start` whose value is a function which is why we can call it like that. We are also passing an object into the parameter of the `start` function.

## Conclusion

If you test your slider now, everything should be working smoothly, and you should have a happy Skinny!

<img src={imgHappyskinnyGif} alt={`happy skinny`} width={172} height={216} />

In the next post, we'll learn about a very important concept in JavaScript and almost every other programming language, **variable scope**.
