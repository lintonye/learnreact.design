## Overview

What you'll learn:

- Passing functions into custom tags
- Custom tag attributes called `props`

## Component Communication

`Slider` and `Skinny` are disconnected, so let's fix it!

Now, we’ve got `<Skinny>` and `<Slider>` beside each other. We want the `Skinny>` component to know the `Slider` position when we drag it so that we can update `Skinny` accordingly.

This is how we communicate between the two.

Before we extracted Skinny and the slider into individual components, they were both in the same `App` component. It was very similar to being in the same room and talking to each other — very easy.

Now that they are in different rooms, we need to change our code to allow them to communicate.

If we are still using `animationControls`,

```jsx
function App(){
  let animationControls = useAnimation()
  function handleDrag(event, info) {
    let newScale = transform(info.point.x, [0, 220],[0.4, 1.5])
    animationControls.start({
      scale: newScale,
      transition:{type: "spring", velocity: 0}
      })
  }
  ...
}
```

we want to pass it into our `Skinny` room.

### Passing functions into custom tags

```jsx{2}
<div ...>
  <Skinny animate={animationControls}/>
  <Slider />
</div>
```

You see, it’s the same format as what we have been doing for other attributes in Frame.

We want to be a little more specific than just animate because we are not animating all of Skinny — only his cheek.

```jsx{2}
<div ...>
  <Skinny cheekAnimate={animationControls}/>
  <Slider />
</div>
```

Our slider is still not working because we haven’t told `Skinny` what to do about this `cheekAnimate`. If we hover over "`<Skinny>`", we get an error that tells us that the `Skinny` component does not know about or how to deal with `cheekAnimate`.

### `props`

We can fix our `cheekAnimate` problem in our `Skinny` component. We first add a parameter to `Skinny`.

```jsx{1}
function Skinny(props) {
    ...
}
```

What is `props`? It’s the parameter of the function and the input of our printer machine `Skinny`. It's called `props` because it is short for properties and is a **React specific term** for the attributes of the custom tag we are defining. All the attributes we set on our `<Frame>` such as `width`, `height`, `position`, `background`, etc are `props`.

This `props` parameter contains the collection of all attributes we use on the tag.

If we have `cheekAnimate`, we'll be able to access the value of the attribute like this.

```jsx{11}
function Skinny(props){
  return (
    ...
    {/* Cheek */}
    <Frame
      background="url(https://cdn.glitch.com/071e5391-90f7-476b-b96c-1f51f7106b0c%2Fcheek.png)"
      width={79}
      height={67}
      left={155}
      top={135}
      animate={props.cheekAnimate}
    />
  </Frame>
  )
}
```

Again, why are we able to use this dot notation to get the value of `cheekAnimate`?

Because `props` is an object!

If you want, you can use `console.log` to print out `props` to see what it actually is. Remember, `console.log` is a powerful tool to figure out what is going in our code!

For this Frame in `Skinny`,

```jsx{5-8}
function Skinny(props){
  return (
    ...
    <Frame
      background="url(https://cdn.glitch.com/071e5391-90f7-476b-b96c-1f51f7106b0c%2Fskinny-portrait.png)"
      width={290}
      height={290}
      borderRadius={150}
    />
    ...
  )
}
```

the props would be `width`, `center`, `background`, and `borderRadius`.

## Conclusion

What we have just done solves half of the puzzle. The `Skinny` component now knows about the `animationControls` we created in our `App` component. Next, let’s link up the `Slider` as well.
