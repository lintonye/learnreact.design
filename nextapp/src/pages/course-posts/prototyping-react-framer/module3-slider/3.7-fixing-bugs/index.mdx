## Overview

What you'll learn:

- Two ways to fix our scale bug
- `onDragEnd`
- Review of `transition`
- Structure of the slider and Skinny animation

## Scale bug

There’s a bug in our slider code and you might have noticed it!

<img src={imgSkinnybugGif} alt={`skinny slider bug`} width={210} height={214} />

This occurs because whenever we drag the slider, we run `handleDrag` very quickly and frequently.

`handleDrag` quickly starts many animations with different scale values. By default, the Framer library animates the scale with a **spring**. If we start multiple spring animations within a short timeframe, the energy of the spring quickly accumulates. At some point, there will be a big bounce. You can see what happens!

There are **two** ways to fix this issue.

### First solution

We can avoid starting so many animations quickly.

In our `onDrag` attribute, the `handleDrag` function is called whenever we drag the knob. Instead, we can use `onDragEnd`.

```jsx
//knob
<Frame
  ...
  onDrag={handleDrag}
/>
```

to

```jsx
//knob
<Frame
  ...
  onDragEnd={handleDrag}
/>
```

Now the handleDrag function is only called after the drag gesture is completed. That is after the user releases the mouse or finger on a touch screen.

<img src={img250DragendGif} alt={`drag end slider`} width={166} height={200} />

Of course, this isn't smooth. If we want to see real-time updates on Skinny’s face, we need the second solution.

### Second Solution

By resetting the starting velocity of the spring, the energy of the spring does not accumulate when we start an animation.

When we start an animation with animationControls, we can configure the animation using `transition`. If you remember the `transition` attribute, what we can put here is exactly the same.

```jsx{7}
function App(){
  let animationControls = useAnimation()
  function handleDrag(event, info) {
    let newScale = transform(info.point.x, [0, 220],[0.4, 1.5])
    animationControls.start({
      scale: newScale,
      transition:{type: "spring", velocity: 0}
      })
  }
  ...
}
```

Also make sure you are using `onDrag` now and not `onDragEnd`.

```jsx
//knob
<Frame
  ...
  onDrag={handleDrag}
/>
```

## Conclusion

Let’s review what exactly is going on here.

We created `animationControls` by calling `useAnimation`. The variable `animationControls` holds the return value of `useAnimation`. We then put `animationControls` into the `animate` attribute of what we want to be animated, in our case is the cheek of Skinny.

This works like a remote control for the animation of the frame. Whenever we call the start function, the animation of the frame will change accordingly.

In our knob frame, we assigned `handleDrag` to the `onDrag` attribute. This `handleDrag` function is called whenever the user drags the knob which will then run the code in the function body.

Now, when the knob moves, we get a new x value from the `info.point.x` object. We then transform it to `newScale` and start a new animation by calling the `start` function in `animationControls`.

In the next post, we'll clean up our code by creating a React component!
