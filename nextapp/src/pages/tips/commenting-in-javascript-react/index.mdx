## Commenting in JavaScript

There are two types of comments in JavaScript:

1. Single-line comments
2. Multiple-line comments

Single line comment are created with two forward slashes (`/`). JavaScript treats the rest of the line after the slashes as comment.

```jsx
// ✅ This is a line comment
// ✅ Each line should start with double slashes
let thisCode = 'not a comment'

let thisCode = 'not a comment' // ✅ this is comment too

let thisCode = // ❌ this comments out the rest of the lin  // 'not a comment'
```

Multi-line comments are created with `/*` and `*/` which serve as brackets. Everything in between is treated as comments, including line breaks.

```jsx
/*
 ✅ This is block comment. Everything between is treated as comments. 
 It works for multiple lines.
*/
let thisCode = 'not a comment'

let thisCode /* ✅ this is comment too */ = 'not a comment'
```

## Commenting in JSX

Sometimes people are confused by how to comment out a portion of the code inside an JSX expression. We can make a comment **_inside_** JSX like so:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* ✅ This is a comment */}
      <div>This is not comment.</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

We can also comment out the entire JSX expression:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    // <div>
    //   <div>This is not comment.</div>
    // </div>
  )
}
```

Why? Because JSX is just syntax sugar. A JSX tag is foundamentally just a JavaScript expression. What's inside the curly braces (`{}`) is JavaScript code too. That's why we can use the block comment `/* */` there.

However, single-line comments don't work inside JSX. Do you know why?

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {// ❌ Line comments don't work in JSX }
      <div>This is not comment.</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```
