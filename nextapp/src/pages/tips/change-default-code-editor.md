# Use "External editor"

The internal editor in Framer X is fine, but sometimes it's buggy and sluggish. You can change it to use an external editor from the menu: `View => Editor => External`.

Pro tip: Using an external editor is a big time saver when you want to work on the code and see the design canvas at the same time.

# Change the default external code editor

VSCode is great but what if you want to use Atom, Vim, Emacs etc.? Answer:

1. File -> Show package
2. Navigate to a .tsx file
3. Right click -> "Get Info"
4. Choose an app in "Open With".
5. Click "Change All" and profit!
