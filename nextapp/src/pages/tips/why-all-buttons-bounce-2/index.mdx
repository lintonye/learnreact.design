## Overview

All three buttons are assigned with the same override `Scale`. Why do they all bounce when only one button is clicked?

Solutions:

- [Use different overrides for each of them](/tips/why-all-buttons-bounce-1)
- Use code component (this tip)

## Why does this happen?

Why? Because all three buttons are associated with the same data source, `data.scale`. When it changes, the `scale` prop of all three buttons are updated accordingly.

We could use [separate code overrides](/tips/why-all-buttons-bounce-1) that associate the buttons with separate data sources. However, it still feels suboptimal -- we'd have to create multiple sets of data and multiple code overrides.

How could we do better? Create a code component!

## Code component

You know what? Things like `animate` and `Animatable` can be used in code components as well. We can pretty much copy the code from Code Override.

- 1. Create a code component and use `Frame` as the root element
- 2. Copy the declaration of `data` into the component class

```jsx
export class Button extends React.Component<Props> {
  ...
  data = Data({ scale: Animatable(1) });
  ...
}
```

- 3. Copy the `onTap` function into the component class, change to an arrow function, and change `data` to `this.data`:

```jsx
export class Button extends React.Component<Props> {
  ...
  onTap = () => {
    this.data.scale.set(0.6);
    animate.spring(this.data.scale, 1);
  }
  ...
}
```

- 4. Add two props, `onTap` and `scale`, to `Frame`. Note: being able to use props like `onTap` and `scale` is why we need to use `Frame`. `div` won't work.

```jsx
<Frame
  onTap={this.onTap}
  scale={this.data.scale}
  ...
/>
```

- 5. Don't forget to import all related things from `framer`:

```js
import { Frame, Data, Animatable, animate } from 'framer'
```
