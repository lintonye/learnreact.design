# Standard usage

In Visual Studio Code, we can select a word and press CMD+D to select other occurrences of the word. Then we get multiple cursors in all these occurrences. When we type something, we get the same text on all these cursors. One stone many birds!

# Pro tip: Preserve case in multi-cursor

Install the [Multiple cursor case preserve](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Cardinal90.multi-cursor-case-preserve) plugin. It'll preserve the case at each cursor when we change the text. This makes it super easy to change things that are in camelCase.
