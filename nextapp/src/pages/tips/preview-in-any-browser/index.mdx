View your preview in any browser by going to http://localhost:4567.

You will need to launch the preview in the app first, but you can tweak the display options and it will show up in the browser preview as well.

If you have multiple project previews open, try next ports such as `http://localhost:4568`, `http://localhost:4569` etc.
