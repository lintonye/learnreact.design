To make the most of [React 101 For Designers](/courses/react-101), you should be familiar with HTML/CSS and the basics of JavaScript.

If you are not, don't worry! I have prepared a free email course that goes through the prerequisite topics of the React course. The topics are hand-picked by me to get you prepared in the shortest time.

It's a few hours' work per week and it'd arrive your inbox every Monday for 6 weeks. I find this weekly format works for most people. But you can fast forward or get all the links at once if you want.

- Week 1: HTML and CSS basics
- Week 2: Flexbox and terminal
- Week 3: JavaScript - variables, strings and functions
- Week 4: JavaScript - logic and if statements
- Week 5: JavaScript - looping
- Week 6: JavaScript - arrays and objects
