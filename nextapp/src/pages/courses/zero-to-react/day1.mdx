## How does a website work?

When you enter the address of your favorite website into a browser, your computer starts a conversation with another computer far away, commonly referred to as _server_. Typically your computer makes a request for some information and the server responds:

> **Your computer:** Yo, what's good about this random site learnreact.design?
>
> **The server:** Hang on, let me grab something for you. Beep. Boop.

The main part of the server's response usually includes three items: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- **HTML** lists the content of a web page and describes its structure -- How many headings and paragraphs are there? What images should a user see? Are this button and that textbox contained in the same box?
- **CSS** is in charge of the layout and makes the page pretty -- Should these two paragraphs sit side by side? What background color should this page have? What font should be used?
- **JavaScript** makes a web page dynamic and interactive -- What happens when a user clicks this button? Where should the data be fetched from? How would we populate the list with the downloaded data?

<!-- TODO illustration -->

To create a website, developers make some HTML, CSS and JavaScript files, taking great care to ensure they work harmonously in a user's browser. The primary medium developers work with is _code_, the text that might look scary but is actually designed to be read and written by humans.

<img src={imgMatrix} alt="The code rain in The Matrix" title="Fortunately the code doesn't look like this." />

Let's check out what they actually look like.

## HTML

### HTML tags

Let's say we want to display a paragraph in a browser:

<img src={imgParagraph} alt="Displaying a paragraph in a browser" width={692} height={447}/>

We could write the HTML code like so:

```html
<p>Hello, I'm a paragraph!</p>
```

The text "Hello, I'm a paragraph!" is self explanatory. But what's that `p` inside `<` and `>` (let's call them _angle brackets_)?

`p` stands for paragraph. We put it inside a pair of angle brackets to make it a **_tag_**. An HTML _tag_ tells the browser the _type_ of the content that we want to include.

HTML provides many tags, like a bag of Lego pieces, which we use to assemble into a web page. There are currently 110+ different tags in HTML. Here are some more examples:

- `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` etc.: Headings
- `<img>`: An image
- `<button>`: A button
- `<div>`: A box used for grouping elements. It's often invisible.

### Elements

HTML tags often come in pairs. As above, we have `<p>` which marks the beginning of a paragraph, and `</p>` which marks the end of a paragraph. They are called **_opening tag_** and **_closing tag_** respectively. The opening tag, closing tag and the content inside are collectively called an **_HTML element_**.

<!-- TODO image: tags, content and element -->

Some elements don't have content and are therefore called **_empty elements_**. For example:

```html
<hr>
```

This will create a "horizontal rule", i.e. a horizontal line, on the page. Unlike a paragraph, a line doesn't have any content. That's why the rule element is empty.

Sometimes you might see empty elements with a trailing slash (`/`) which is equivalent to the tag without it, for example:

```html
<hr />
```

Note: while the trailing slash is optional in HTML, it's required in some other environments (e.g. React). I'll go over this when it's time to learn JSX in React.

### Attributes

On the opening tag, we can add **_attributes_**, which include extra information about an element. For example:

```html
<p class="abstract">Hello, I'm a paragraph!</p>
```

Above, we add a `class` attribute to `p`. `class` is the name of the attribute, and `abstract` is its value. The attribute value is always inside a pair of quotes.

This `class` attribute tells the browser that we want to style the paragraph in a certain way. We'll learn this soon in the CSS section.

We can add more than one attributes to a tag, which are separated by whitespaces, like so:

```html
<img src="https://TODO" alt="TODO">
```

### HTML element anatomy

As a recap, here's an anatomy of an HTML element:

<img src={imgAnatomy} alt="HTML element anatomy" width={1024} height={592}/>

### Nesting elements

In the example above, the content of a `p` element is some text. But we can put another element inside an element as its content too. For example:

```html
<div>
  <input type="email" placeholder="Your Email">
</div>
```

Or maybe multiple elements inside as the content of the `div`:

```html
<div>
  <input type="email" placeholder="Your Email">
  <input type="password" placeholder="Password">
</div>
```

The `input` elements are also called the ***children*** of the `div`. Conversely, the `div` is the ***parent*** of the `input` elements.

In fact, this `div` element can be put inside another element too, for example:

```html
<form>
  <div>
    <input type="email" placeholder="Your Email">
    <input type="password" placeholder="Password">
  </div>
</form>
```

Now the `div` element is the content of the `form` element.

This idea of repeating things following a pattern logically is very common in coding. The pattern in this example is: the content of an element can be another element, which can include yet another element as its content, so on and so forth. In theory, this embedding structure can go infinitely deep.

```html
<div>
  <div>
    <div>
      <div>
        <div>
          .
          .
          .
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Finally, it's also OK to mix text and HTML elements as the content:

```html
<p>Domo is a <strong>tree</strong></p>
```

This just means that this `p` has two children, the first child is the text `Domo is a ` and the second child is the `strong` element.

### Paring opening and closing tags

It's important to pair the opening and closing tags. The code is invalid if the closing tag of a non-empty element is missing, e.g.

```html
<!-- ❌ missing closing div tag -->
<div>
  <input type="email" placeholder="Your Email">
  <input type="password" placeholder="Password">  
```

The order of closing tags is also important. The code is invalid if the opening tags and closing tags are not matched properly:

```html
<!-- ❌ form tag and div tag are interwined -->
<form>
  <div>
    <input type="email" placeholder="Your Email">
    <input type="password" placeholder="Password">
  </form>
</div>
```

### Exercise time!

Alright! This is all you need to know about HTML (for now). Here's a list of all the terms mentioned above. Try to recall what they are:

- Opening and closing tags
- HTML element
- Empty element
- Attributes
- Nesting elements
- Children and parents

If you find this list daunting, don't worry! With enough practice (which you'll do in the next 7 days), it'll become your second nature to write those HTML tags. Flex your muscles with some quick quizzes first:

**Q1: Is the HTML code below valid?**

```html
<div>Domo is a <strong>tree</div></strong>
```

<Quiz
  options={['Yes', 'No. Text cannot be mixed with another tag', 'No. The closing tags are not embedded correctly.', 'None of the above']}
  id="zero-to-react-day1-mix-text-and-element"
  answer="C"
  explanation=""
/>

**Q2: Is the HTML code below valid?**

```html
<img src="https://somesite.com/cat.jpg" alt="Cat">
```

<Quiz
  options={['Yes', 'No. The closing tag is missing.', 'No. The tag needs a trailing slash right before ">"', 'No. Too many attributes']}
  id="zero-to-react-day1-empty-element"
  answer="A"
  explanation="Similar to <hr>, <img> is an empty element. In HTML, the trailing slash is optional."
/>

**Q3: Which of the following is INCORRECT about nesting HTML elements?**

<Quiz
  options={['An element can have more than one children.', 'A nesting structure can be as deep as needed.', 'An empty element can still have children.', 'An element can be embeded in another element because its content can be elements.']}
  id="zero-to-react-day1-nesting"
  answer="C"
  explanation="Empty elements, by definition, cannot have children."
/>

**Write some code!**

Let's now get our hands dirty and write some HTML code! Build something like the following:

<div className="shadow-lg p-2 border border-gray-200">
  <img src={imgCodingExercise} width={605} height={477} />
</div>

Hints:

- Use these tags: `input`, `button`, `p` and `img`
- The image url is :

```html
https://learnreact.design/_next/image?url=%2F_next%2Fstatic%2Fmedia%2Fdomo-css-artist.cd87d45a513dd11f89f2e854f5ae1a7b.png&w=1920&q=75
```

- Try using a `label` as the parent of the text `Search` and the `input` element
- Try using a `form` as the parent of `label` and `button`
