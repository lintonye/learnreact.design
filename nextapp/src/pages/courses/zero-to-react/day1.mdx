## How does a website work?

Let's get started from the very beginning. Have you ever wondered how a website work? Watch the 2-minute video below:

## HTML, CSS and JavaScript

As covered in the [what is React article](/posts/what-is-react), when you visit a website, the main part of the server's response includes three items: HTML, CSS and JavaScript

- HTML lists the content of a web page and describes its structure. How many headings and paragraphs are there? What images should a user see? Are this button and that textbox contained in the same box?
- CSS: Layout & Make the the page pretty
- JavaScript: Adds interactivity

Now let's look into how to write HTML and CSS code.

### HTML code format

<button>Click me</button>
```
