# Basics
- Animated premier
- `NavigationCardStack` and how it works (brief)
- `NavigationTransitioner`

# Fade transition and rotate transition
- useNativeDriver is currently buggy
- In Transitioner, two things are animated: position (current => nextProps.index) and progress (0-1)
- in NavCardStack, all scenes in the stack are rendered. Proof using HierarchyViewer

# Shared element transition

# Enter / exit transitions (as in Android)
